<p class='c009'>Eighteen years ago, when the
throne of Charles X. was overturned
amidst the universal exultation of
the liberal party in this country, we
ventured, amidst the general transports,
to arraign the policy and condemn
the morality of the change.
We pleaded strongly, in several
articles,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> that that great event foreboded
nothing but a long series
of calamities to France and to
Europe; that liberty had been rendered
impossible in a country which,
casting aside all the bonds of religion
and loyalty, had left no other
foundation for government but force;
and that the external peace of the
Continent would be put in imminent
peril by an ardent military population,
heated by the successful
issue of one great revolt, placed in
the midst of monarchies in which the
feudal institutions and chivalrous
feelings were still in ascendency.
We doubted the stability of a government
founded on the success of one
well-organised urban insurrection: we
distrusted the fidelity of men who had
begun their career by treachery and
treason. Nominally the aggressor,
we concluded that Charles X. was
really on the defensive; he attempted
a <i><span lang="fr">coup d’état</span></i>, because government in
any other way had become impossible.
We were told in reply, that
these were antiquated and exploded
ideas; that the revolution was necessary
to save the liberties of France
from destruction; that a new era had
opened upon mankind with the fire of
the Barricades; that loyalty was no
longer required when the interest of
mankind to be well governed was
generally felt; and that a throne surrounded
by republican institutions
was the best form of government,
and the only one in which the monarchical
principle could any longer
be tolerated in the enlightened states
of modern Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>With how much vehemence these
principles were maintained by the
whole whig and liberal party in Great
Britain, need be told to none who
recollect the rise of the dynasty of
the Barricades in the year 1830. To
those who do not, ample evidence of
the general delusion, and of the perseverance
with which it was combated,
will be found in the pages of this
Journal for 1831 and 1832. Time
has rolled on, and brought its wonted
changes on its wings. More quickly
than we anticipated, the perilous
nature of the convulsion which had
proved victorious was demonstrated—more
clearly than we ventured to
predict, was the necessity of Prince
Polignac’s ordinances demonstrated.
It soon became apparent that France
could be governed only by force.</p>

<p class='c009'>The government of Louis Philippe
was a continual denial of its origin—an
incessant effort to crush the spirit
which had raised it. The repeated
and sanguinary disorders in Paris;
the two dreadful insurrections in
Lyons; the awful drowning of the
revolt of the cloister of St Méry in
blood; demonstrated, before two years
had elapsed, that the government had
felt the necessity of extinguishing the
visionary ideas which had been
evoked, as the means of elevating itself
into power. More than once it
stood on the edge of the abyss; and
it was saved only by the vigour of
the sovereign, and the newly awakened
terrors of the holders of property,
which prevented them from openly
coalescing with the determined republicans,
who aimed at overturning all
the institutions of society, and realising
in the nineteenth century the
visions of Robespierre and Babœuf
in the eighteenth. In the course of
this protracted struggle, the new
government felt daily more and more
the necessity of resting their authority
on force, and detaching it from the
anarchical doctrines, amidst the triumphs
of which it had taken its rise.
Paris was declared in a state of siege;
the ordinances of Polignac were reenacted
with additional rigour; the
military establishment of the country
was doubled; its expenditure raised
from nine hundred millions to fifteen
hundred millions francs; an incessant
and persevering war waged with the
democratic press; and Paris surrounded
by a chain of forts, which effectually
prevented any other will from governing
France but that of the military
who were in possession of their bastions.
Such was the result to the
cause of freedom in France of the
triumph of the Barricades.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in eighteen years an entirely new
generation rises to the active direction
of affairs. In 1848, the personal
experience, the well-founded fears,
the sights of woe which had retained
the strength of France round the
standards of the Barricades, were
forgotten. The fearful contests with
anarchy by which the first years
of the reign of Louis Philippe had
been marked, had passed into the
page of history, that is, were become
familiar to a tenth part only of the
active population. To those who did
learn it from this limited source, it
was known chiefly from the volumes
of M. Louis Blanc, who, in his “Ten
years of the reign of Louis Philippe,”
painted that monarch in no other
light but as one of the most deceitful
and sanguinary tyrants who ever disgraced
humanity. Thus the lessons
of experience were lost to the vast
majority of the active citizens. The
necessity of keeping at peace, which
Louis Philippe so strongly felt, and
so energetically asserted, became in
the course of years an insupportable
restraint upon a people fraught with
revolutionary ideas, and heated by the
glowing recollections of the Empire.
A nation containing six millions of
separate landed proprietors,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> the
great majority of whom were at the
plough, and not possessed of six
pounds a-year in the world, necessarily
chafes against any power which
imposes the restraints of order and
peace on the appetite for plunder and
the lust of conquest. This was the
true secret of the fall of the dynasties
of the Restoration and the Barricades.
They fell because they kept the nation
at peace with its neighbours, and at
peace with itself,—because they terminated
the dream of foreign conquest,
and checked the visions of
internal utopia; because they did not,
like Napoleon, open the career of arms
to every man in the country capable
of carrying a musket; or, like Robespierre,
pursue the supposed advantage
of the working classes by the destruction
of every interest above them in
society. Had either Charles X. or
Louis Philippe been foreign conquerors,
and the state of Europe had
permitted of their waging war with
success, they would have lived and
died on the throne of France, and left
an honoured crown to their successors.
There never were monarchs who
mowed down the population and
wasted the resources of France like
Napoleon and Louis XIV.; but as long
as they were successful, and kept open
the career of elevation to the people,
they commanded their universal attachment.
It was when they grew
unfortunate, and could call them only
to discharge the mournful duties of
adversity, that they became the
objects of universal execration. The
revolution has ever been true to its
polar star, viz.—worldly success.</p>

<p class='c009'>In making these observations, we
must guard against being misunderstood.
We do not assert that the
<em>present</em> leaders of the Revolution desire
foreign war, or are insincere in
the pacific professions which they
have put forth in their public proclamations.
We have no doubt that
“Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,”
is what they really desire; and that
with England in particular they are
sincerely desirous to remain, at present
at least, on terms of amity. The early
promoters of the Revolution of 1789—Siêyes,
Bailly, Mirabeau, and
Lafayette—were equally loud and
probably sincere in their pacific protestations
at the outset of the
first convulsion. What we assert is
another proposition entirely corroborated
by past history, and scarcely less
important in its present application—viz.,
that the members of the existing
Revolutionary Government are placed
in a false position; that they have been
elevated to power by the force of passion,
and the spread of principles inconsistent
with the existence of society;
that if they continue to fan them, they
will ruin their country, if they attempt
to coerce them, they will be destroyed
themselves. This is the constant and
dreadful alternative in which a Revolutionary
Government is placed, and
which has so uniformly led in past
history to what is called a departure
from the principles of freedom by its
successful leaders. It was this which
brought Lafayette into such discredit
in Paris, that his life was saved only
by his fortunate confinement in an
Austrian dungeon: it was this which
rendered Mirabeau in the end a royalist,
and for ever ruined him in popular
favour: it was this which made
Robespierre strive to restore the sway
of natural religion in the infidel metropolis:
it was this which gave Napoleon
such a horror of the metaphysical
“Ideologues,” who, according to
him, had ruined France, and rendered
him the resolute and unbending opponent
of the Revolution. But even
Napoleon’s iron arm was unequal to
the task of arresting the fiery coursers
of democracy: he only succeeded in
maintaining internal tranquillity by
giving them a <em>foreign</em> direction. He
turned them not against the Tuileries,
but against the Kremlin; he preserved
peace in France only by waging war
in Europe. A “Napoleon of Peace”
will never succeed in restraining the
Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>Observe the pledges with which the
Provisional Government are commencing
their career. They are, that the
state is to provide employment for all
who cannot procure it from private
individuals; that an ample remuneration
is to be secured to labour; that
the right of combination to raise wages
is to be protected by law; that the
House of Peers is to be abolished, as
well as all titles of honour, the bearing
of which is to be absolutely prohibited;
that a noble career to all Frenchmen is
to be opened <em>in the army</em>; the national
representation is to be placed on the
most democratic basis of a National
Assembly, elected by <em>nine millions</em> of
electors; all burdens on subsistence are
to be abolished; unlimited circulation
is to be provided for newspapers and
the extension of knowledge; but <em>the
taxes</em>, in the mean time at least, are to
undergo <em>no diminution</em>. These promises
and pledges sufficiently demonstrate
what interest in the state has
<em>now</em> got the ascendency. It is the
interest, or rather <em>supposed</em> interest, of
<em>labour</em>, in opposition to that of capital—of
numbers against property.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Revolution that has taken place
is a communist or <em>socialist</em> triumph;
the chiefs who have been installed in
power are the leaders of the party who
think that the grand evil of civilisation
is the encroachment of the profit of
capital on the wages of labour, and
that the only effectual remedy for them
is to be found in the forcible diminution
of the former and extension of
the latter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctrine of this party in France
has long been, that Robespierre perished
because he did not venture to pronounce
the word, <em>agrarian law</em>. It
would be to little purpose to pronounce
that word now, when the Republic
has got nearly six millions of separate
proprietors, most of them not worth
six pounds a-year each. There is
little but sturdy resistance to be got
by attempting to spoliate this immense
and indigent body, as they have
spoliated the old territorial proprietors.
But the capitalists and shopkeepers
of towns stand in a different
situation. In their hands, since the
fall of Napoleon, very considerable
wealth has accumulated. The peace
and order maintained by the governments
of the Restoration and the Barricades,
though fatal to themselves, has
been eminently favourable to the
growth of bourgeois opulence. It is
against <em>that</em> opulence that the recent
Revolution was directed. The shopkeepers,
deluded to their own destruction,
began the insurrection:
they surrounded and compelled the
abandonment of the Tuileries. All
successful convulsions are headed, in
the first instance at least, by a portion
of the higher or middle ranks. But
they were soon passed by the rabble
who followed their armed columns;
and when the tumultuous mob broke
into the Chamber of Deputies, fired at
the picture of Louis Philippe, and
pointed their muskets at the head of
the Duchess of Orleans, it was too late
to talk of Thiers and Odillon Barrot;
the cause of reform was already passed
by that of Revolution; and nothing
could serve the victorious and highly
excited multitude, but the abolition of
monarchy, peers, and titles of honour,
and the vesting of government in the
hands of dreamers on equality, and
leaders of Trades’ Unions in France.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let the National Guard, who
brought about the Revolution, and
seduced or overcame the loyalty of
the troops of the line, explain, if they
can, the benefit <em>they</em> are likely to derive
from this triumph of Socialism
over Bourgeoisie, of labour over
capital, of numbers over property.
The Revolution was the work of
their hands, and they must reap its
fruits, <em>as unquestionably they will
bear its responsibility</em>. It is of more
importance for us in this country
to inquire how the promises made by
government, and the expectations
formed by the people, are to be realised
in the present social and political
state of France. Already, before
the <em>Io Pæans</em> upon the fall of the
Orleans dynasty have ceased, the difficulties
of the new government in
this respect have proclaimed themselves.
Columns of <em>ten and fifteen</em>
thousand workmen daily wait on the
administration to insist on the immediate
recognition of the rights of
labour: their demands were promptly
acceded to by the decree of 3d March,
which fixes the hours of labour in
Paris at <em>ten</em> hours a-day, <em>and in the
provinces at eleven</em> hours. They were
formerly eleven hours in Paris and
twelve in the provinces. This is
quite intelligible: it is reasonable that
the Civil Prætorian Guards of the
capital should work less than the
serfs of the provinces. Cutting off
an hour’s labour over a whole country
would be deemed a pretty serious
matter in “l’industrieuse Angleterre:”
but on the other side of the
Channel, we suppose, it is a mere
bagatelle, important chiefly as showing
from what quarter the wind sets.
Other prognostics of coming events
are already visible. Monster meetings
of operatives and workmen in
and around Paris continue to be held
in the Champs de Mars, to take the interests
and rights of labour into consideration:
it is probable that they
will still further reduce the hours of
toil, and proportionately raise its
wages. Already the stone-cutters
have insisted on a minimum of pay
and maximum of work, and got it.
Eight hours a-day, and ten sous
an hour, is their ultimatum. The
journalists early clamoured for the
immediate removal of all duties
affecting them. They succeeded in
shaking off their burdens; other
classes will not be slow in following
their example. Meanwhile
government is burdened, as in the
worst days of the first Revolution,
with the maintenance of an immense
body of citizens with arms in their
hands, and very little bread to put
into their mouths. How to feed this
immense body, with resources continually
failing, from the terrors of
capital, the flight of the English from
Paris, and the diminished expenditure
of all the wealthier classes, would,
according to the former maxims of
government, have been deemed a
matter of no small difficulty. But we
suppose the regenerators of society
have discovered some method of
arriving, with railway speed, at public
opulence amidst private suffering.</p>

<p class='c009'>The melancholy progress of the first
Revolution has naturally made numbers
of persons, not intimately acquainted
with its events, apprehensive
of the immediate return of the Reign
of Terror and the restoration of the
guillotine into its terrible and irresistible
sovereignty in France. Without
disputing that there is much danger
in the present excited and disjointed
state of the population of
that country, there are several reasons
which induce us to believe that such
an event is not very probable, at
least in the <em>first instance</em>, and that it is
from a different quarter that the real
danger that now threatens France is,
in the outset at least, to be apprehended.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place, although the
Reign of Terror is over, and few indeed
of the actual witnesses are still in
existence, yet the recollection of it
will never pass away: it has affixed
a stain to the cause of revolution
which will never be effaced, but which
its subsequent leaders are most anxious
to be freed from. Its numerous tragic
scenes—its frightful atrocity—its
heroic suffering, have indelibly sunk
into the minds of men. To the end
of the world, they will interest and
melt every succeeding age. The
young will ever find them the most
engrossing and attractive theme,—the
middle-aged, the most important
subject of reflection,—the old, the
most delightful means of renewing
the emotions of youth. History is
never weary of recording its bloody
catastrophes,—romance has already
arrayed them with the colours of
poetry,—the drama will ere long seize
upon them as the finest subjects that
human events have ever furnished for
the awakening of tragic emotion.
They will be as immortal in story as
the heroes of the Iliad, the woes of
the Atrides, the catastrophe of Œdipus,
the death of Queen Mary. So
strongly have these fascinating tragedies
riveted the attention of mankind,
that nothing has ever created
so powerful a moral barrier against
the encroachments of democracy. The
royal, like the Christian martyrs,
have lighted a fire which, by the grace
of God, will never be extinguished.
So strongly are the popular leaders
in every country impressed with the
moral effects of these catastrophes,
that their first efforts are always
now directed to clear every successive
convulsion of their damning influence.
Guizot and Lafayette, at the hazard
of their lives, in December 1830, saved
Prince Polignac and M. Peyronnet
from the guillotine; and the first act of
the Provisional Government of France
in 1848, to their honour be it said, was
to proclaim the abolition of the punishment
of death for political offences,
in order to save, as they intended,
M. Guizot himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the next place, the bloodshed
and confiscation of the first Revolution
have, as subsequent writers have repeatedly
demonstrated, so completely
extinguished the elements of national
resistance in France, that the dangers
which threatened its progress and ensanguined
its steps no longer exist.
It was no easy matter to overturn
the monarchy and church of old
France. It was interwoven with the
noblest, because the most disinterested
feelings of our nature,—it touched
the chords of religion and loyalty,—it
was supported by historic names,
and the lustre of ancient descent,—it
rested on the strongest and most dignified
attachments of modern times.
The overthrow of such a fabric, like
the destruction of the monarchy of
Great Britain at this time, could not
be effected but by the shedding of
torrents of blood. Despite the irresolution
of the king, the defection of
the army, the conquest of the capital,
and the emigration of the noblesse,
accordingly, a most desperate resistance
arose in the provinces; and the
revolution was consolidated only by
the <em>mitrillades</em> of Lyons and Toulon,
the <em>noyades</em> of the Loire, the proscriptions
of the Convention, the blood of
La Vendée. France was not then
enslaved by its capital. But now these
elements of resistance to the government
of the dominant multitude at
Paris no longer exist. The nobles
have been destroyed and their estates
confiscated; the clergy are reduced to
humble stipendiaries, not superior in
station or influence to village schoolmasters;
the corporations of towns
are dissolved; the house of peers has
degenerated into a body of well-dressed
and titled employés. Six
millions of separate landed proprietors,
without leaders, wealth, information,
or influence, have seized upon
and now cultivate the soil of France.
Power is, over the whole realm,
synonymous with office. Every
appointment in the kingdom flows
from Paris. In these circumstances,
how is it possible that resistance to
the decrees of the sovereign power,
in possession of the armed force of
the capital, the treasury, the telegraph,
and the post-office, can arise in
France elsewhere than in the capital?
Civil war, therefore, on an extended
scale over the country, is improbable;
and the victorious leaders of the Revolution,
delivered from immediate
apprehension, save in their own metropolis,
of domestic danger, have no
motive for shocking the feelings of mankind,
and endangering their relations
with foreign powers, by needless and
unnecessary deeds of cruelty. It was
during the struggle with the patricians
that the proscriptions of Sylla
and Marius deluged Italy with blood.
After they were destroyed, by mutual
slaughter and the denunciations of
the Triumvirate, though there was
often the greatest possible tyranny
and oppression under the emperors,
there was none of the wholesale destruction
of life which disgraced the
republic, when the rival factions
fronted each other in yet undiminished
strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although, however, for these reasons,
we do not anticipate, at least <em>at
present</em>, those sanguinary proscriptions
which have for ever rendered
infamous the first Revolution, yet we
fear there is reason to apprehend
changes not less destructive in their
tendency, misery still more widespread
in its effects, destined, perhaps,
to terminate at last in bloodshed
not less universal. Men have
discovered that they are not mere
beasts of prey: they cannot live on
flesh and blood. But they have
learned also that they can live very
well on capital and property: and it
is against these, in consequence, that
the present Revolution will be directed.
They will not be openly
assailed: direct confiscations of possessions
have fallen almost as much
into disrepute as the shedding torrents
of blood on the scaffold. The thing
will be done more covertly, but not
the less effectually. They will take
a leaf out of the former private lives
of the Italians, and the recent public
history of Great Britain. We have
shown them that, under cover of a cry
for the emancipation of slaves, property
to the amount of one hundred
and twenty millions can be quietly
and securely destroyed in the colonies;
that, veiled under the disguise of placing
the currency on a secure basis, a
third can be added to all the debts,
and as much taken from the remuneration
of every species of industry,
throughout the country. These are
great discoveries, they are the glory of
modern civilisation: they have secured
the support of the whole liberal party
in Great Britain. The <em>objects</em> of the
French Revolutionists are wholly different,
but the mode of proceeding
will be the same. The stiletto and
the poison bowl have gone out of
fashion: they are discarded as the
rude invention of a barbarous age.
The civilised Italians have taught us
how to do the thing. Slow and unseen
poison is the real secret; there
are Lucretia Borgias in the political
not less than the physical world. The
great thing is to secure the support
of the masses by loud professions of
philanthropy, and the warmest expressions
of an interest in the improvement
of mankind; and having roused
them to action, and paralysed the
defenders of the existing order of
things by these means, then to turn
the united force of the nation to their
own purposes, and the placing of the
whole wealth of the state at their
disposal. Thus the ends of Revolution
are gained without its leaders
being disgraced: the substantial advantages
of a transfer of property are
enjoyed without a moral reaction
being raised up against it. Fortunes
are made by some, without a direct
spoliation of others being perceived:
multitudes are involved in misery, but
then they do not know to what cause
their distresses are owing, nor is
any peculiar obloquy brought upon
the real authors of the public calamities.</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not say that the present Provisional
Government of France are
actuated by these motives, any more
than we say that our negro emancipators
or bullionists and free-traders
meant, in pursuing the system which
they have adopted, to occasion the
wholesale and ruinous destruction
of property which their measures
have occasioned. We consider both
the one and the other as <em>political
fanatics</em>; men inaccessible to reason,
insensible to experience; who
pursue certain visionary theories of
their own, wholly regardless of the
devastation they produce in society,
or the misery they occasion in whole
classes of the state. “Perish the
colonies,” said Robespierre, “rather
than one iota of principle be abandoned.”
That is the essence of political
fanaticism; it rages at present
with equal violence on both sides of
the Channel. The present Provisional
Government of France are some of them
able and eloquent—all of them, we
believe, well-meaning and sincere men.
But they set out with discarding the
lessons of experience; their principle
is an entire negation of all former systems
of government. They think a
new era has opened in human affairs:
that the first Revolution has destroyed
the former method of directing mankind,
and the present has ushered in
the novel one. They see no bounds
to the spread of human felicity, by
the adoption of a social system different
from any which has yet obtained
among men. They have
adopted the ideas of Robespierre without
his blood,—the visions of Rousseau
without his profligacy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The writings of Lamartine and
Louis Blanc clearly reveal these principles,
particularly the “Histoire des
Girondins” of the former, and the
“Dix Ans de l’Histoire de Louis
Philippe” of the latter. Lamartine
says the Girondists fell because they
did not, on the 10th August 1792,
when the throne was overturned,
instantly proclaim a republic, and go
frankly and sincerely into the democratic
system. If he himself falls, it
will not be from a repetition of the
error; he has done what they left
undone. We shall see the result. Experience
will prove whether, by discarding
all former institutions, we
have cast off at the same time the
slough of corruption which has descended
to all from our first parents.
We shall see whether the effects of
the fall can be shaken off by changing
the institutions of society; whether
the devil cannot find as many agents
among the Socialists as the Jacobins;
whether he cannot mount on the
shoulders of Lamartine and Arago as
well as he did on those of Robespierre
and Marat. In the meantime, while
we are the spectators of this great experiment,
we request the attention of
our readers to the following interesting
particulars regarding the acts of
the new government, the professions
they have made, the expectations
which are formed of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the most popular journals
of the working classes of Paris—that
is, the present rulers of France—the
<cite><span lang="fr">Democratie Pacifique</span></cite>, has adopted the
following mottoes:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Revolution of 1789 has destroyed
the old Regime; that of 1848 should
establish the new one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Social reform is the end, as Republic
is the means; <em>all the Socialists are
Republicans, all the Republicans are
Socialists</em>.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The methods by which the plans
of the Socialists are to be worked out,
are in the same journal declared to
be as follows:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>“PROGRAMME OF THE PEOPLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“A man with a heart,—a man greatly
loved by the working classes, has lent
his hand to the formation of a programme
dictated by the popular will. The ideas
on which it rests, treated as utopian yesterday,
have no need to be discussed to-day.
The last Revolution is an explosion
of light which has dissipated the
darkness. The Socialist ideas railed at
yesterday, accepted to-day, will be realised
to-morrow. Its principles are,—</p>

<p class='c014'> “I. <em>The rights of labour.</em>—It is the duty
of the state to furnish employment, and
if necessary a <em>minimum</em> of wages, to all
the members of society whom private
industry does not employ.</p>

<p class='c014'>“II. <em>House of refuge</em> for industry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“III. Despotism must be for ever disarmed
by the transformation of the army
into <em>industrial regiments</em>, (en regiments
industriels,) suited alike to the defence of
the territory and the execution of the
great works of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c014'>“IV. <em>Public education, equal</em>, gratuitous,
and obligatory upon all.</p>

<p class='c014'>“V. Savings’ banks (caisses d’épargne)
which keep capital dead, shall be <em>vivified
by labour</em>: the people who produce all
riches can afford to be their own bankers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“VI. A universal reform of <em>law courts</em>,
juries every where.</p>

<p class='c014'>“VII. Absolute <em>freedom of communications
of thought</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“VIII. A <em>progressive scale of taxation</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“IX. A progressional <em>tax on machinery</em>
employed in industry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“X. An effectual guarantee for a <em>fair
division of profits</em> between the capitalists
and the workmen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“XI. A <em>tax on luxury</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“XII. <em>Universal suffrage.</em></p>

<p class='c014'>“XIII. A <em>national assembly</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“XIV. <em>Annual elections by all.</em></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Vive la Republique!</div>
      <div class='line'>Gardons nos armes!”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>To carry out these principles, they
propose a general centralisation of
all undertakings in the hands of
government, to be brought under the
direct control of a simple majority
of universal suffrage electors. In
the same journal we find the following
proposals:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>“ABSORPTION OF RAILWAYS BY THE STATE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Let us reproduce to-day, with the
certainty of being heard by the country,
the wishes which the <cite><span lang="fr">Democratie Pacifique</span></cite>
has announced every morning since
its origin, seventeen years ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I. All railways, roads, canals, and
public ways, by which the life of France
circulates, to be <em>absorbed by the state</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“II. The state should undertake all
stage-coaches, carriers, waggons, and
means of conveyance or transport, of
every description.</p>

<p class='c014'>“III. All joint-stock banks should be
absorbed by the state—(A l’état les
banques confédérées.)</p>

<p class='c014'>“IV. All insurance companies, mines,
and salt-works, to be undertaken by the
state.</p>

<p class='c014'>“V. No more forestalling, accumulating,
regrating, or <em>anarchical competition</em>.
Feudal industry is pierced to the heart;
let us not allow it to raise itself from
the dust.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>Such are the proposals to be found
in a single journal which represents
the ideas that are now fermenting
in the mind of France.</p>

<p class='c009'>These propositions will probably
“<span lang="fr">donnent à penser</span>,” as the French
say, to most of our readers. Some of
them will perhaps be of opinion that
our lively neighbours are getting on at
railway speed in the regeneration of society.
We recommend their projects to
the consideration of the numerous
holders of French railway and other
stock, in the British islands. They
will doubtless get good round sums
for their claims of damages against
the French government, when it
has <em>absorbed</em> all the joint-stock companies
of the country!—the more so
when it is recollected, 1st, That the
damages will be assessed by juries
elected by universal suffrage. 2d,
That they will be paid by a government
appointed by an assembly
elected in the same way. We are
not surprised, when such ideas are
afloat in the ruling and irresistible
workmen of Paris, who have just
overturned Louis Philippe, at the
head of one hundred thousand men,
that the French funds have fallen
<em>thirty-five per cent</em> in these few days,
and railway and other stock in a still
greater proportion. The Paris 3 <em>per
cents</em> are now (March 18) at 50; the
5 per cents at 72!</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor let it be said these ideas are
the mere dreams of enthusiasts, which
never can be carried into practice by
any government. These enthusiasts
are now the ruling power in the state;
their doctrines are those which will
quickly be carried into execution by
the liberal and enlightened masses,
invested by universal suffrage with
supreme dominion in the Republic.
Most assuredly they will carry their
ideas into execution: the seed
which the liberal writers of France
have been sowing for the last
thirty years, will bring forth its
appropriate fruits. What power is
to prevent the adoption of these
popular and highly lauded “improvements,”
after the government
of Louis Philippe and Guizot has
been overturned by their announcement?
These persons stood as
the barrier between France and the
“social revolution” with which it
was menaced: when they were destroyed,
all means of <em>resisting</em> it are
at an end, and the friends of humanity
must trust to prevent its extension
to other states, mainly to the
reaction arising from its experienced
effects in the land of its birth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already there appears, not merely
in the language of the popular journals,
but in the official acts of the
Provisional Government, decisive evidence
that the <em>socialist ideas</em> are
about to be carried into execution by
the supreme authority in France.
On March 1st, there appeared the following
decree of the Provisional
Government:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Provisional Government, considering
that the revolution made by the
people should be made for them:</p>

<p class='c014'>“That it is time to put an end to the
long and iniquitous sufferings of the
working classes:</p>

<p class='c014'>“That the question of labour is one of
supreme importance:</p>

<p class='c014'>“That there can be no higher or more
dignified preoccupation of the Republican
Government:</p>

<p class='c014'>“That it becomes France to study
ardently, and to solve, a problem which
now occupies all the states of Europe:</p>

<p class='c014'>“That it is indispensable, without a
moment’s delay, to guarantee to the
people the fruits of their labours:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Provisional Government has
decreed,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“That a permanent commission shall
be formed, which shall be entitled, ‘The
Commission of Government for the Labourers,’
and charged, in a peculiar and
especial manner, with their lot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To show the importance which government
attaches to this commission, it
names one of its members, M. Louis
Blanc, president of the commission, and
for vice-president, another of its members,
M. Albret, mechanical workman.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Workmen are invited to form part of
the commission.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It shall hold its sittings in the palace
of the Luxembourg.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>How is the Provisional Government
to <em>find funds</em> for the enormous
multitudes who will thus be thrown
upon them, or to satisfy the boundless
expectations thus formed of them, and
which their own acts have done so
much to cherish? Already the want
of money has been experienced.
Nearly all the banks of Paris have
failed; the savings’ banks have been
virtually confiscated, by the depositors
being paid only a tenth in specie,
and the Bank of France has suspended
cash payments. The government has
got into an altercation with a class of
the highest importance, under existing
circumstances, which is striving
to liberate itself from the imposts
which are more immediately felt by
it. So early as March 2d, the journalists
claimed an exemption from
the stamp duties on the public journals;
and on the government hesitating
to comply with their requests,
they loudly demand the dismissal of
M. Cremieux, the new minister of
justice. The <cite><span lang="fr">Democratie Pacifique</span></cite> of
March 2d, observes—</p>

<p class='c017'>“The greatest danger of our situation
is, not that which comes from without,
but that which comes from within. The
most imminent danger would be the
slightest doubt on the intentions of government,
the least retrograde step in the
presence of events. That disquietude, we
are bound to admit, already exists in the
minds of many—distrust is the precursor
of revolutions.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The government has had under its
eyes the conduct of the people. Let it
imitate it. Energy, constant energy, is
the only way to do good. The people
have proved it. It is by energy alone that
the prolongation of struggles is prevented—the
effusion of blood arrested—dangerous
reactions averted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Forward, and Force to power! Such
is the double cry of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Chamber of Deputies and of
Peers must not only be interdicted from
meeting; like royalty, they must be abolished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“M. Cremieux, the minister of justice,
has forgotten his principles. He is not
prepared for the part he has to perform.
He blindly yields to old attachments and
prejudices. At the moment when the
most absolute liberty of the press, the
most rapid and ceaseless emission of ideas,
is the sole condition of the public safety—at
the moment when we are in the midst
of a chaos from whence we cannot escape
if light does not guide our steps—at that
moment M. Cremieux proposes to extinguish
it—he proposes this, a retrograde
step, to the minister of finance—the reestablishment
of the stamps on journals.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A revolution of yesterday cannot be
thus braved.</p>

<p class='c014'>“These gentlemen wish a republic surrounded
by republican institutions.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>The people have not yet laid down
their arms.</em>”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>The government, after having made
a show of resistance, yielded to their
masters. The duties on journals
were abolished, and absolute freedom
given to the pouring of the rankest
political poisons into the mind of
France.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is easy to see, with a government
resting on such a basis, where the
first practical difficulty will be found.
Embarrassment of finance is the rock
on which it will inevitably split: the
more certain that it has been preceded
by a huge deficit created by the
former government; the more galling
that it will be accompanied by the
flight or hoarding of capital from the
measures of the present one. Capitalists
are universally alarmed over
the whole country. A monetary
crisis, as is the case with all successful
revolutions, and that too of the
severest kind, has ensued. M. Gouin’s
bank, the same which formerly bore
the name of Lafitte, has failed under
liabilities to the extent of three millions.
Nearly all the other banking establishments
of Paris have already followed
the example. The payment of all bills
was, by government, postponed for
three weeks, from February 28: a farther
extension of the time of payment
for a month after March 20, has been
petitioned for by <em>eight hundred of the
first bankers and merchants in Paris</em>.
This amounts to a declaration of a
general public and private insolvency.
Overwhelmed by the difficulties of
his situation, the first minister of
finance has resigned; the second, M.
Garnier Pages, has published a
financial account, which exhibits so
deplorable a state of the finances,
that it may almost be said to amount
to an admission of national bankruptcy.
Despite all the efforts made
to uphold them, the French three per
cents, on this publication, fell to forty-seven.
The terrors of the holders of
stock are extreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>An able eye-witness gives the following
account of the state of Paris,
amidst this terrible social and financial
crisis.—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have seen daily and intimately
persons of all parties; Legitimatists, <i><span lang="fr">Conservateurs</span></i>,
or adherents of the late government—adherents
of the Molé Ministry of
half-an-hour—adherents of the Barrot
Ministry, equally short-lived—friends and
intimates of members of the Provisional
Government. I can most truly and distinctly
affirm, that I saw and heard
nothing from any of them but alarm and
consternation; mingled with the strongest
condemnation of the two conflicting
parties whose obstinacy had brought
about a collision which every body had
feared, though no one’s fears had come
within the widest range of the reality.
I heard only expressions of the conviction
that the present order of things could
not last; that, in spite of the heroic
efforts, the excellent intentions, and the
acknowledged talents of several members
of the government, it had undertaken to
construct an edifice which must fall and
crush them under its ruins; that it was
now forced by fear upon promises, and
would be forced upon acts utterly inconsistent
with the stability of any government
whatever. In short, the profoundest
anxiety and alarm sit at the heart of the
educated classes of France, of whatever
party—and, not the least, of those who
have undertaken the awful task of ruling
her. Of that you may be fully assured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“English Liberals will perhaps say
‘This we expected; but the people?’
Well, I must affirm that, if by ‘people’
they mean the industrious, quiet working-classes,
the real basis of society, the object
of the respect and solicitude of all enlightened
rulers—if they mean these men,
the alarm and consternation are greater
among them than in the higher classes,
in proportion to the slenderness of the
resources they have to fall back upon; in
many cases this amounts to a sort of
blank despair. The more clear-sighted
among them see the terrible chances that
await them; they see <em>capital leaving the
country, confidence destroyed, and employment
suddenly suspended or withdrawn,
to an extent never seen before</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me mention a few small but
significant facts:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“My locksmith told me he had always
employed four men; he has discharged
three. An English pastry-cook, who has
constantly employed fifteen journeymen,
was about to discharge nearly all. <em>Every
body is turning away servants, especially
men, as the more expensive.</em> I was told
that good carriage-horses had been sold
for five hundred francs each. A vast
number of houses are becoming tenantless;
the removal of the English alone
would make a visible change in this
respect. And what, think you, are the
feelings of all the tribe of water-carriers,
washerwomen, and the humble dependents
for existence on these houses?
Nothing, during the three days, seemed
to be more affecting and alarming than
the sight of these humblest ministrants
to the prime wants of life rushing from
door to door, even in the quietest streets,
to get their hard labour accomplished in
safety. Our <i><span lang="fr">porteur d’eau</span></i> was every
morning our earliest informant of the
events of the night, and I was struck with
the good sense and clearness of his views.
‘<i><span lang="fr">Ces messieurs parlent d’égalité</span></i>,’ he said:
‘<i><span lang="fr">est ce qu’ils veulent se faire porteurs d’eau?
C’est absurde—ce sont des mensonges.</span></i>’
(‘These gentlemen talk of equality: will
they turn water-carriers? It is absurd—these
are lies.’) ‘<i><span lang="fr">Ils vont nous ruiner
tous.</span></i>’ (‘They are going to ruin us all.’)
These last words I heard frequently
repeated by persons of the working
classes. A poor commissioner, who, for
high pay, and through long <i><span lang="fr">détours</span></i>, conveyed
a letter for me on the 23d, came
in looking aghast. ‘<i><span lang="fr">Nous voilà sans
maître.</span></i>’ (‘Here we are without a master,’)
said he. ‘<i><span lang="fr">Bon Dieu! qu’est ce que
nous allons devenir?</span></i>’ (‘Good God! what
will become of us?’) ‘<i><span lang="fr">Un pays sans maître
ce n’est plus un pays.</span></i>’ (‘A country without
a master is no longer a country.’)
‘<i><span lang="fr">Nous allons retomber dans la barbarie.</span></i>’
(‘We shall fall back into barbarism.’)
This, indeed, was so soon felt by all, that
masters were appointed. But has that
restored the feeling of reverence for
authority, or of confidence in those who
wield it, indispensable to civil society?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard with astonishment English
people on the road saying, ‘Oh, all is quiet
now.’ ‘All is going on very well now.’
From no Frenchman have I heard this
superficial view of the case. Paris is indeed
quiet enough, but it is the quiet of
exhaustion, fear, distrust, and dejection.
The absolute silence of the streets at night
was awful. But a few nights before the
22d, I had complained of the incessant roll
of carriages during this season of balls.
From the night of the 26th to the 3d of
March, the most retired village could not
have been more utterly noiseless. Not a
carriage—not a foot-fall—except at intervals
the steady and silent step of the
patrol of the National Guard, listened for
as the sole guarantee for safety. ‘Every
man,’ said a grocer, wearing the uniform
of the Guard, to me in his shop,
‘must now defend his own. We have no
protectors but ourselves; no police, no
army.’”—<cite>Times</cite>, March 8, 1848.</p>

<p class='c009'>These are sufficiently alarming
features in the political and social
condition of any country: but they
become doubly so, when it is recollected
that they coexist with unbounded
expectations formed in the labouring
masses, in whom supreme power
is now both practically and theoretically
vested. The Revolution has been
the triumph of the workmen over the
employers, of the “<i><span lang="fr">proletaires</span></i>” over
the “bourgeois,” of labour over
capital. How such a triumph is to
eventuate with a vehement and indigent
population, impelling the government
on in the career of revolution,
and capital daily leaving the
country or hiding itself from the dread
of the acts of a government about to
be appointed by <em>nine millions of
electors</em>, is a question on which it well
becomes all the holders of property,
in whatever rank, seriously to reflect
in this country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some idea of the extravagance and
universality of their expectations may
be formed from the following passage
in the description of a still later eye-witness:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Paris is to all appearance tranquil;
but there is much agitation that does
not show itself outwardly. <em>The workmen
of all trades are intent on legislation which
shall secure more wages for less toil.</em> They
beset the Luxembourg with processions,
and fill the Chamber of Peers with deputations.
Louis Blanc has discovered
that to organise labour in a pamphlet
and put the theory into practice are two
very different things. The walls are covered
with the manifestoes of the several
branches of occupation; every day sees
a new crop; they reveal the existence
of dissentions among the workmen themselves,
though they are all based on
nearly the same principles; the seven-hooped
pot is to have ten hoops, and it is
to be felony to drink small-beer. The
cochers have secured a tariff, with an advance
of wages; the tailors are demanding
the same; the ‘cheap’ establishments
are in despair, for they supply classes
that cannot buy at higher prices. An
anxious employer placed the difficulty
before some of the men; the only answer
recorded was the comforting assurance
that every body will be able to pay five
pounds for his coat ‘as soon as society is
regenerated!’ What is to be said to
such magnificence of hope? A <i><span lang="fr">citoyen</span></i>
coatmaker can only shrug his shoulders
and wait for the end. One step has been
taken that seems likely to lead to it—the
Commission has opened <em>a register of all
employments, and all seeking to be employed,
in Paris</em>. Not till the stern truth
is revealed by figures will the full difficulty
be known, and some estimate
formed of what a government can <em>not</em> do.
All the edicts that can be forced from it
by the pressure of the hour will break
down under the weight of necessity, as
they always have done.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Parallel with this agitation, which is
material, runs another, which is philosophical.
The republic is not perfect
enough, and some vile distinctions still
exist, irritating to the eye of equality.
The government is petitioned to abolish
all marks of honour for civilians; the
names of distinguished citizens can be
recorded in a golden book, a <i><span lang="fr">livre d’or</span></i>
of the Republic, as the recompense of
great services; but no cross or riband
is to be worn. Equality <i><span lang="fr">devant la mort</span></i>
is also insisted on; the same place in the
cemetery and the same bier for all are to
render the grave in appearance, as in
reality, the great leveller. This proscription
of the poor vanities of life and death
is made a serious object by some of the
active spirits of the time, as if there were
any real importance in them.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>—<cite>Times</cite>,
March 13th, 1848.</p>

<p class='c016'>If, with material resources continually
and rapidly diminishing, capital
leaving the country, employment failing,
bankruptcies general, the expenditure
of the opulent at an
end, the finances of the State in
hopeless embarrassment, the French
Government can satisfy these extravagant
wants and expectations without
plunging in a foreign war, they
will achieve what has never yet been
accomplished by man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Who is answerable for this calamitous
Revolution, which has thus
arrested the internal prosperity of
France, involved its finances in apparently
hopeless embarrassment, thrown
back for probably half a century the
progress of real freedom in that
country, and perhaps consigned it to
a series of internal convulsions, and
Europe to the horrors of general war,
for a very long period? We answer
without hesitation that the responsibility
rests with two parties, and two
parties only—the King and the National
Guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King is most of all to blame,
for having engaged in a conflict, and,
when victory was within his grasp,
allowing it to slip from his hands from
want of resolution at the decisive
moment. It is too soon after these
great and astonishing events to be
able to form a decided opinion on the
whole details connected with them;
but the concurring statements from
all parties go to prove that on the
<em>first</em> day the troops of the line were
perfectly steady; and history will
record that the heroic firmness of the
Municipal Guard has rivalled all that
is most honourable in French history.
The military force was immense; not
less than eighty thousand men,
backed by strong forts, and amply
provided with all the muniments of
war. Their success on the first day
was unbroken; they had carried above
a hundred barricades, and were in
possession of all the military positions
of the capital. But at this moment
the indecision of the King ruined
every thing. Age seems to have extinguished
the vigour for which he
was once so celebrated. He shrunk
from a contest with the insurgents,
paralysed the troops by orders not to
fire on the people, and openly receded
before the insurgent populace, by
abandoning Guizot and the firm
policy which he himself had adopted,
and striving to conciliate revolution
by the <i><span lang="fr">mezzo termine</span></i> of Count Molé,
and a more liberal cabinet. It is with
retreat in presence of an insurrection,
as in the case of an invading army;
the first move towards the rear is a
certain step to ruin. The moment it
was seen that the King was giving
way, all was paralysed, because all
foresaw to which side the victory
would incline. The soldiers threw
away their muskets, the officers broke
their swords, and the vast array, equal
to the army which fought at Austerlitz,
was dissolved like a rope of sand.
Louis Philippe fell without either the
intrepidity of the royal martyr in
1793, or the dignity of the elder
house of Bourbon in 1830; and if it
be true, as is generally said, that the
Queen urged the King to mount on
horseback and die “en roi” in front
of the Tuileries, and he declined,
preferring to escape in disguise to this
country, history must record, with
shame, that royalty perished in
France without the virtues it was
entitled to expect in the meanest of
its supporters.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second cause which appears to
have occasioned the overthrow of the
monarchy in France, is the general,
it may be said universal, defection of
the National Guard. It had been
openly announced that twenty thousand
of that body were to line the
Champs Elysés <em>in their uniform</em> on
occasion of the banquet; it was perfectly
known that that banquet was a
mere pretext for getting the forces of
this Revolution together; and that the
intention of the conspirators was to
march in a body to the Tuileries after
it was over, and compel the King to
accede to their demands. When
they were called out in the afternoon,
they declined to act against the
people, and by their treachery occasioned
the defection of the troops of
the line, and rendered farther resistance
hopeless. They expected, by this
declaration against the King of their
choice, the monarch of the barricades,
to secure a larger share in the government
for themselves. They went to
the Chamber of Deputies, intending
to put up the Duchess of Orleans as
Regent, and the Count of Paris as
King, and to procure a large measure
of reform for the constitution. What
was the result? Why, that they
were speedily supplanted by the
rabble who followed in their footsteps,
and who, deriding the eloquence
of Odillon Barrot, and insensible to
the heroism of the Duchess of Orleans,
by force and violence expelled the
majority of the deputies from their
seats, seized on the President’s chair,
and, amidst an unparalleled scene of
riot and confusion, subverted the
Orleans dynasty, proclaimed a Republic,
and adjourned to the Hotel
de Ville to name a Provisional Government!
The account given of
this whole revolt by an eye-witness,
which has appeared in the <cite>Times</cite>,
is so instructive, that we make no
apology for transferring it to our columns:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“On the afternoon of Wednesday, Feb.
23, Paris was greatly agitated, but no
severe fighting had taken place; a few
barricades had been raised and retaken
by the troops; the plans of the government
were complete—Marshal Bugeaud
had been named to the command of the
forces in Paris, and M. Guizot informed
the King that he was confident that the
Executive Government could put down
the insurrection. The royal answer was—a
dismissal. The King dismissed M.
Guizot, and dissolved the Cabinet at that
momentous instant, when all the energies
of united power were required to fight in
the streets a battle which it had itself
deliberately provoked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Still, however, the mischief might yet
have been repaired if vigorous measures
had been taken. But, from that hour,
nothing but the most extraordinary blunders
and pusillanimity marked the conduct
of the Court. Count Molé was sent for,
and the evening of Wednesday passed in
attempts, or no attempts, we hardly know
which, on his part to form a semi-Liberal
Cabinet. In the city, the fall of the
Guizot ministry was hailed with acclamation
and illumination, as the first sign
of popular victory; and at that same
critical juncture the fatal discharge of
musketry took place opposite the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, which stained the
pavement with blood, and inflamed the
people to a revolutionary pitch. The
night was spent in preparation for a more
terrible morrow; but as yet the army
had neither fraternised nor laid down its
weapons. It was, on the contrary, for
the most part prepared to act; but a circumstance
occurred at Court which totally
paralysed its resistance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“After Count Molé’s failure, the King
sent for M. Thiers. That gentleman may
be said to have actually formed a Cabinet
in conjunction with M. Odillon Barrot
and M. Duvergier de Hauranne, for they
instantly proceeded to the discharge of
the highest possible duty which could
devolve on ministerial responsibility.
The one act of their government was the
publication of that inconceivable proclamation,
stating that <em>no further resistance
should be made, and the promulgation of
orders to the officers commanding regiments
to withdraw them</em>. This was of
course the capitulation of the Monarchy.
Marshal Bugeaud—who had the command
of the troops, had now completed his preparations
for the general attack of the
barricades, and was confident of success—protested
most energetically against this
extraordinary order, and said that if it
was acted on all was lost. The King’s
then ministers, M. Thiers and M. Barrot,
insisted; the King took their advice, and
Marshal Bugeaud resigned the command
of the troops, observing that it was useless
for him to retain it if nothing was to be
done. General Lamoricière was therefore
named to the command of Paris, and
M. Thiers and his friends proceeded to
effect their pacific arrangements. The
effects of their orders were immediately
perceptible, although the declaration of
their names was certainly not followed
by the consequences they had anticipated.
The officers of the army, indignant at so
unexpected a termination of their duties,
sheathed their swords; the men allowed
themselves to be disarmed by the mob,
whom they had been ordered not to resist,
and the people, encountering no serious
opposition except from the Municipal
Guard, which was cut to pieces, rushed
on to the conquest of the Palais-Royal
and the Tuileries. To sum up this narrative
in two words—the dismissal of the
Guizot government rendered it impossible
for the Executive Government to act effectually;
the subsequent advice of M.
Thiers and the resignation of Marshal
Bugeaud, rendered it impossible to act at
all. If this be, as we have every reason
to believe it is, a correct narrative of
these transactions, we are not surprised
that M. Thiers and his colleagues should
not have made themselves conspicuous
in the subsequent passage of this Revolution.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The mob of Paris, at no hour of the
day, (the 24th,) was formidable to ten
thousand men, much less to a hundred
thousand, or at least eighty thousand.
On the Thursday (24th) public opinion
had abandoned the <i><span lang="fr">émeute</span></i>. <em>The National
Guard would now have done any thing to
reproduce order, but they had no time</em>;
there was no opportunity to reunite themselves;
besides which, they wanted courage
and support, and did not <em>even dream of the
extreme to which things might be pushed</em>.
There never was, at any time, any
<i><span lang="fr">acharnement</span></i> among the people; the troops
were every where well received; not a
hostile head looked from a window. It
was hoped that something might be done
by a demonstration of public opinion, but
nothing more. The <i><span lang="fr">émeutiers</span></i> the first and
second day simply took advantage of the
absence of the National Guard. They were
all the time ill looked upon by the real
people of Paris, but they were permitted
to go on as a means of action on the court
and government. The accident, or rather
the gross and infamous blunder, committed
before the Bureau des Affaires Etrangères
(of which the accounts published are
erroneous), produced a violent irritation,
which was ably worked upon by the Republican
committee, who were all along
on the watch; but this irritation, which
certainly changed the character of the
contest, gave no arms to the people; and
although it increased their numbers, they
were never, even numerically, formidable,
as I have said, to ten thousand men. As
for the barricades, there was not one that
was ever defended except against some
weak patrol, and then, after a little popping,
it was always abandoned. Literally,
there was no fighting; there was skirmishing
on the part of the brave Municipals—the
only force that acted—and I
presume it acted on orders which did not
emanate from the chief military authority,
but had some separate and general
instructions of its own. Literally, I repeat,
there was no fighting. How could
there be? There were no arms; that is,
not a musket to a hundred men, till
eleven or twelve o-clock in the day, when
the troops, without orders—except “not
to fire,” or act against the people—became,
in several parts of Paris, mixed up
and united with them.”—<cite>Times</cite>, March 8
and 14, 1848.</p>

<p class='c016'>Here, then, is the whole affair clearly
revealed. It was the timidity of
Government, and the defection of the
National Guard, which ruined every
thing; which paralysed the troops of
the line, encouraged the insurgents,
left the brave Municipal Guards to
their fate, and caused the surrender of
the Tuileries. And what has been
the result of this shameful treachery
on the part of the sworn defenders of
order—this “<em>civic</em>” prætorian guard
of France? Nothing but this, that
they have destroyed the monarchy,
ruined industry, banished capital, rendered
freedom hopeless, and made
bankrupt the state! Such are the
effects of armed men forgetting the first
of social duties, that of fidelity to their
oaths. How soon were these treacherous
National Guards passed in the
career of revolution by the infuriated
rabble! How soon were Odillon Barrot
and Thiers supplanted by Lamartine
and Arago! How rapidly were
the Duchess of Orleans and the Count
of Paris expelled at the point of the
bayonet from the Chamber of Deputies—the
cry for reform drowned in
that of revolution! How many of the
twenty thousand National Guards,
who by their treachery brought
about the Revolution, will be solvent
at the end of two months? Not a
tenth of their number. They will
perish deservedly and ignobly; ruined
in their fortunes, beggared in their
families, despised by their compatriots,
execrated by Europe! That they may
anticipate what history will say of
their conduct, let them listen to the
verdict which it <em>has</em> pronounced on
the National Guard which, on a similar
crisis, 10th August 1792, betrayed
Louis XVI., as pronounced by an
authority whom they will not suspect
of leaning to the Royalist side—M.
Lamartine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The National Guard, on the 10th
August, returned humiliated and in
consternation to their shops and
counting-houses; <em>they had justly lost
the lead of the people</em>. Thenceforth
it could no longer aspire but to be the
parade force of the Revolution, compelled
to assist at all its acts, at all
its fêtes, <em>at all its crimes; a vain living
decoration of all the mechanists of the
Revolution</em>.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Of which revolution is Lamartine
now speaking; of that of 10th August
1792, or of 24th February 1848? Beyond
all doubt history will pass a
severer judgment on the treachery
which overthrew Louis Philippe than
on that which consummated the destruction
of Louis XVI.: for the former
had the example of the latter for
its guide; they knew how soon the
massacre of September followed the
triumph of August, and what incalculable
calamities the defection of
their predecessors in the Place
Carousel brought upon their country
and Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>What benefit have the working
classes derived, or are they likely to
derive, from this deplorable convulsion?
Great ones they doubtless
expect, as it has issued in a triumph
of labour over capital. But what has
it realised? We shall mention one
or two particulars to illustrate the
benefits hitherto reaped by this class
from its victory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The savings’ banks of France had
prospered immensely under the firm
and pacific government of Louis
Philippe. The following account of
them is derived from official sources.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The state of the savings’ banks in
France at the time of the Revolution indicated
an extraordinary degree of confidence
in the stability of the late government.
In 1834 there were only seventy
savings’ banks in France, and the amount
of deposits on hand was 34,000,000 francs.
In 1839 there were four hundred and four
banks, and the deposits had increased to
171,000,000 francs; in 1848, at the moment
of the Revolution, the deposits had
risen to 355,000,000 francs, or ten times
the amount deposited fourteen years before.
In 1839 the average value of each
deposit was 550 francs, which is probably
increased to 600 francs average at the
present time. The partial suspension of
payment by these institutions must affect
at least half a million of persons of the
most industrious and economical part of
the population, chiefly belonging to the
towns, and they are deprived of a large
portion of their savings at the very moment
they most need them.”—<cite>Times</cite>,
March 14, 1848.</p>

<p class='c016'>Now, these savings’ banks, holding
deposits to the amount of about
£14,000,000 at the commencement
of the Revolution, and which had
increased <em>tenfold</em> during Louis
Philippe’s reign, have to all practical
purposes <em>been rendered bankrupt</em>.
Unable to stand the dreadful run
upon them after the outbreak, or to
realise the amount of their deposits
by the sale of their funded property, in
consequence of its prodigious fall, they
had no resource but to suspend payment.
By a decree of Government,
the holders of deposits in the savings’
banks are to receive only <em>a tenth</em> in
cash, the remainder being payable six
months hence, in a paper now practically
worth nothing. By this single
result of the Revolution, above five
hundred thousand of the most meritorious
and hard-working of the
operatives of France have been in
effect deprived of the savings of a
whole lifetime.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor is the condition of the labouring
population in any degree more
favoured. In the <cite>Times</cite> correspondent
from Paris of March 14, we find
the following account of their present
condition:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“The financial question, the state of
trade and commerce, and the task of providing
work and food for the people, with
which the government has charged itself,
are additional motives for seriousness,
however. The credit of more than one
banking-house is to-day said to be tottering.
One firm, it is openly mentioned,
has resolved to stop payment to-morrow.
Trade is very bad. Work will soon become
scarce, and distress and outcry must
be expected; and with the knowledge of
all these facts, and with the determination
to do every thing possible for the relief of
the working classes, possessed by the
Provisional Government, this source of
uneasiness is menacing to-day. I wish a
more cheerful view of the situation of
affairs were more general than it is, for it
might check the departure of rich natives
and foreigners from the capital, who <em>continue
to retire from it in alarming numbers</em>,
and, obviously, with no view to return, for
we hear of sales of carriages and horses,
for a <em>fifth part of the value</em> they bore three
weeks since. <em>Twelve thousand servants
are said to be already discharged</em> in Paris,
and many houses or hotels in the fashionable
quarters have become literally devoid
of occupants.”—<cite>Times</cite>, 14th March
1848.</p>

<p class='c016'>That such a state of things must in
the end terminate in domestic or
foreign war must be evident to all
who have looked even on the surface
of past events. The causes which
at present uphold, and must ere long
destroy the Republican Government
in France, are thus ably stated by the
Paris correspondent of the same well-informed
journal:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Provisional Government continues
to exist at the moment only from
two causes. The first is, that all respectable
persons hasten to its support under
the influence of fear. The other day every
body expected to be robbed and murdered:
as the Provisional Government showed a
strong desire to preserve order, all those
individuals, still surprised to find themselves
unplundered and unassassinated,
attributed the miracle to the government,
and ran to its support in self-defence.
The adhesions have been readier and
more numerous many times over than in
1830. The second cause which gives a
short reprieve to the government is, that
it <em>humours the ferocious monster that made
it</em>,—and which is ready at any moment to
overturn it as it set it up,—by the most
absurd indulgences, by still more fatal
promises for the future. The same set of
ruffians (heroes) who forced the Chamber,
and who thrust the Provisional Government
on the deputies, are still there to
invade the Hotel de Ville, and substitute
another idol for Lamartine &#38; Co. Still I
believe they will not do so just yet;
perhaps we may get on till the constitutional
or National Assembly meets, but
I doubt it. But then, even then,—what
is to take place? Faction, clubs,
war to the knife. The French are precisely
the same men they were in ‘89—they
are not changed in the least. Classes
have been modified by wealth, commerce,
prosperity, &#38;c.; but <em>these are the quiet
classes, who will be swallowed up in the
course of the next five years</em>. At the present
moment the working, or the <i><span lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i>
working classes, who are literally
the sovereign power, are looked upon
with fear, disgust, and abhorrence by
every man in France of a superior condition,
<em>including the National Guard</em>; and
they are all speculating how to get quit
of them; while, on the other hand, Louis
Blanc is keeping them quiet by preaching
Utopianism. He is doing so, honestly
and enthusiastically, it is said; and certain
it is, that a great mass of the people
is flattered and soothed by the idea of
converting work into an amusement, of obtaining
perpetual easy employment by the
state, and a pension at fifty-five years of
age. This pause, however, does not deceive
the commerce, <em>the capital, the education
of France, and, as I said, the universal
consideration is how to throw off the
many-headed tyrant</em>. The plan of doing
so, most consonant with the French character,
is war. The National Guard is
convinced they must shortly fight these
men themselves, or send them to fight
the foreigner; the latter is the expedient
that will be hit upon; and unfortunately
the state of Europe incites them
to interfere in the concerns of others, from
whom they will receive invitations which,
in the condition of men’s minds in this
country, it will be impossible for any government
to reject. Besides which, even
Frenchmen of the best order are, on questions
of national glory or honour, not to
be relied on for a moment; the best of
them may be carried away by a word, a
paragraph, a rumour, and all rave ‘Frontier
of the Rhine,’ ‘Waterloo,’ and a
thousand other follies, which, however
sad, may be excused in the present state
of their neighbours, though not for that
reason the less to be lamented. In all
international questions whatever, the characteristics
of the French are arrogance,
and susceptibility of so extreme a nature,
that no body of Frenchmen can be dealt
with by foreigners. A sovereign and a
minister or two in cold blood, and with all
the weight of undivided responsibility
upon them, are difficult enough to manage
even by the ablest and most impartial of
negotiators; but the masses must always
be intractable.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I give the present Provisional Government
immense credit for their efficient
exertions, and I have considerable reliance
on the good intentions of the majority
of them; but they will not last; and,
above all, whether they last or not, they
must obey and not pretend to guide.
Lamartine, by his genius, has now and
then gained a point; but he, as well as the
rest, have been rather <em>the organs of the
sovereign of the day than his directors and
guides</em>.”—<cite>Times</cite>, March 13, 1848.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not surprising that views of
this description should be entertained
by all well-informed persons on the
spot in France, for the new “National
Assembly,” to whom the formation of
a constitution is to be intrusted in that
country, is to be composed in such a
way, as renders the direct or indirect
spoliation of property a matter of almost
certainty. The following is the
decree of the Provisional Government
on the subject:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>“<span class='sc'>French Republic.</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.</span></p>

<p class='c014'>“The Provisional Government of the
Republic, wishing to resign, as soon as
possible, into the hands of the Definitive
Government the powers it exercises in
the interest and by the command of the
people,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Decrees,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 1.—The electoral assemblies
are convoked in each district for the 9th
of April next, to elect the representatives
of the people in the National Assembly,
which is to frame the constitution.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 2.—The election shall have
the population for its basis.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 3.—The total number of the
representatives of the people shall be
900, including those of Algeria and the
French colonies.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 4.—They shall be apportioned
by the deputies in the proportion indicated
in the annexed table.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 5.—The suffrage shall be direct
and universal.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 6.—All Frenchmen, 21 years
of age, having resided in the district
during six months, and not judicially deprived
of or suspended in the exercise of
their civic rights, are electors.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 7.—All Frenchmen, 25 years
of age, and not judicially deprived of or
suspended in the exercise of their civic
rights, are eligible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 8.—The ballot shall be secret.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 9.—All the electors shall vote
in the chief town of their district, by
ballot. Each bulletin shall contain as
many names as there shall be representatives
to elect in the department.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No man can be named a representative
of the people unless he obtain 2,000
suffrages.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Article 10.—Every representative of
the people shall receive an indemnity of
25f. per day during the session.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Here is a tolerably democratic constitution,
which will probably excite
some little disquietude in the breasts
of the holders of French stock and
railway shares. Universal suffrage—a
single assembly of nine hundred
members, each of whom is to be paid
a pound a-day during the session. To
make the experiment still more perilous,
the minister of public instruction
to the Provisional Government has
issued a circular to the ministers of instruction
throughout the country, in
which he enjoins them to recommend
to the people “<em>to avoid the representatives
who enjoy the advantages of education
or the gifts of fortune</em>.”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> This
circular excited, as well it might, such
a panic in Paris, that the other members
of the Provisional Government
were obliged to disown it. But
that only makes matters worse: it
shows what the Provisional Government
really meant, and how completely
they have already come to
stand on the verge of civil war. The
projected decree for levelling the
National Guard, by distributing the
companies of voltigeurs and chasseurs
(the <i><span lang="fr">élite</span></i>) through the whole mass,
has already produced an address by
their battalion, <em>in uniform</em>, to the Provisional
Government, which was
received at the Hotel de Ville by
an immense crowd with cries of
“<i><span lang="fr">A bas les Aristocrats! on ne passe
pas!</span></i>” It is no wonder the National
Guard are at length alarmed. The
aristocracies of knowledge and property
are to be alike discarded!
Ignorance and a sympathy with the
most indigent class are to be the great
recommendations to the electors!
This is certainly making root-and-branch
work; it is Jack Cade alive
again. Paris, it is expected, will return
for its representatives</p>

<p class='c020'>Truly the National Guard will soon reap
the whirlwind; we are not surprised the
French funds have undergone so prodigious
a fall. The holders of Spanish
bonds and American States’ debts
know how universal suffrage assemblies
settle with their state-creditors.
Sidney Smith has told the world
something on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “pressure from without” on
the Provisional Government becomes
every day more severe and alarming
as time rolls on: wages cease, stock
falls in value, savings’ banks suspend
payment, and all means of relief, save
such as may be extorted from the
fears of the government, disappear.
The following is a late account of
the state of matters in this important
respect, from the French metropolis:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“France, crowded, impoverished, indebted,
and straitened at all points, sees
an opening in the exercise of a sovereign
people’s will. It gets a glimpse of light
and life through the Hotel de Ville.
Hence this desperate competition for the
national resources; and hence, we grieve
to add, this wasteful and improvident
distribution.</p>

<p class='c014'>“These deputations are a congenital
evil. They began from the very moment
the Provisional Government was proclaimed
in the Chamber of Deputies. Its
progress thence from the Hotel de Ville
was a deputation. The members immediately
began to thunder at the doors
and clamour for admittance. A club
orator has since boasted that, had it not
been for this importunity, nothing would
have been done—that not a step has
been taken without external impulse—and
that the people had to wait two
hours, on that wonderful Thursday, before
the Provisional Government would
announce a republic. Since that moment
the deputations may be said <em>never to
have ceased in Paris</em>. For the first
week they did not affect a distinctive
character, but came as accident had
thrown them together—<em>ten thousand
from this quarter, and twenty thousand
from that; sometimes the people, and
sometimes the National Guard, or a medley
of all sorts. In those days they were
armed.</em> Lamartine had to turn out six
times a-day, make gestures half an hour
for a hearing, and then spend his brilliant
eloquence on a field of bayonets and
blouses. When the poet had sunk from
sheer exhaustion, the indefatigable deputation
adjourned to the Ministry of the
Interior, and drew forth M. Ledru Rollin,
who had not learned his way about
the apartments, or the names of the officials,
before he was required to promulgate,
off-hand, a complete system for the
internal administration of France. It is
possible that his first thoughts might
have been as good as his second on this
subject; but the demand was nevertheless
premature. The stream of deputation
has since become less turbid, violent,
and full; but it has been quite continuous,
and, to all appearance, <i><span lang="la">Labitur et
labetur in omne volubilis œvum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We believe there is not a single
branch of employment or of idleness in
Paris, that has not marched <i><span lang="fr">en masse</span></i> to
the Hotel de Ville to demand <em>more wages,
less work, certainty of employment, and a
release from all the rules and restrictions
which the experience of their masters had
found to be necessary</em>. It is unwise to
damp the expectations of five thousand
armed men. In some cases, therefore,
the government capitulated on rather
hard terms. By and by it adopted what
we really think the best possible alternative.
It requested the trades to nominate
their several deputies, and set the
operative parliament to adjust all its
rival pretensions at the Luxembourg.
Then there came deputations of women,
of students, of pawnbrokers’ tickets, of
bankers, of bread-eaters, of bread-makers,
of cabmen, of ’bussmen, of sailors, of
porters, of every thing that had, or had
not, an office and a name. France, of
course, has had the precedence, having,
in a manner, the first start; but the
nations of the earth are beginning to find
room in the endless procession. All the
world will run into it in time. The vast
column is just beginning to form in
Chinese Tartary, and is slowly debouching
round the Caspian Sea. Already we
see a hundred European sections. They
follow in one another’s trail. An Anacharsis
Clootz is waiting to receive them
at the barriers, and marshal them to the
Hotel de Ville.”—<cite>Times</cite>, March 15, 1848.</p>

<p class='c016'>This state of matters is certainly
abundantly formidable to France and
to Europe. A great experiment is
making as to the practicability of the
working-classes governing themselves
and the rest of the state, without the
aid of property or education. France
has become a <em>huge trades-union</em>, the
committee of which forms the Provisional
Government, and the decrees of
which compose the foundation of the
future government of the republic.
Such an experiment is certainly new
in human affairs. No previous example
of it is to be found, at least, in
the old world; for it will hardly be
said that the republic of 1793, steeped
in blood, engrossed in war, ruled
with a rod of iron by the Committee
of Public Salvation, is a precedent to
which the present regeneration of
society will refer, in support of the
principles they are now reducing to
practice. We fear its state has been
not less justly than graphically described
by one of our most distinguished
correspondents, who says—“They
are sitting as at a pantomime;
every thing is grand and glorious;
France is regenerated, and all
is flourish of trumpets. Meanwhile
France is <em>utterly insane—a vast lunatic
asylum without its doctors</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The present state of Paris, (March
21,) and the germs of social conflict
which are beginning to emerge from
amidst the triumph of the Socialists,
may be judged of from the following
extracts of the correspondent of the
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, dated Paris, 18th
March:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Paris, Friday Evening.—There has
been another day of great excitement and
alarm in Paris. Upwards of thirty thousand
of the working classes congregated
in the Champs Elysés, and went in procession
to the Hotel de Ville to assure
the Government that it might depend
upon their assistance against any attempt
that might be made to coerce it, from
whatever quarter it came. I need hardly
inform you that this formidable demonstration
is intended as a <i><span lang="fr">contre coup</span></i> to
the protest presented by the National
Guards yesterday, against M. Ledru Rollin’s
decree dissolving the grenadier and
light companies of the National Guards.
It is not the least alarming feature in
this affair, that it exhibits an amount of
discipline among the working classes, and
a promptitude of execution, which are
but too sure indications both of the power
and the readiness of the leaders of the
movement to do mischief. It was only
yesterday that the demonstration took
place which displeased the masses; yet,
in one short night, the order goes forth,
the arrangements are made, and before
ordinary mortals are out of their beds,
thirty thousand of the working classes are
marshalled under their leaders, and on
their march to make a demonstration of
their force, in presence of the executive
government—a demonstration which, on
the present occasion, to be sure, is favourable
to the Government, but which to-morrow
may be against it. Who have
the orders proceeded from that drew
together these masses? How were they
brought together? The affair is involved
in mystery, but there is enough in it to
show an amount of organisation for which
the public was not prepared; and which
ought to show all those within its operation
that they are sitting upon a barrel
of gunpowder. The fact is—and there
is no denying or concealing it—Paris is
in the possession of the clubs, who rule
not only it, but the ostensible government.
The National Guards, so powerful only a
week ago, are now impotent whether for
good or evil. “A house divided against
itself cannot stand.” The National
Guards have quarrelled. The Chasseurs
look with jealousy on the <i><span lang="fr">compagnies
d’élite</span></i>—the <i><span lang="fr">compagnies d’élite</span></i> will not
fraternise with the Chasseurs. The
eighty-four thousand men, who formed
the National Guards before the 24th of
February, look with contempt on the
one hundred and fifty thousand new men
thrust into their ranks by M. Ledru Rollin,
for election purposes, and call them
<i><span lang="fr">canaille</span></i>. The new levies feel that they
cannot compete in wealth with the good
company in which they so unexpectedly
find themselves, and they call the old
guards <i><span lang="fr">aristocrats</span></i>. Add to this the discontent
of the grenadier and light companies
at being deprived of their distinctive
associations and dress, the displeasure of
the old officers, who are about to be deprived
of their epaulettes by their new
and democratic associates, and the intriguing
of the would-be officers to secure
a majority of suffrages in their own
favour, and you may arrive at a judgment
of the slight chance there is of the
National Guards of the present day uniting
for any one purpose or object. The
result of this is obvious. In case of an
outbreak, the National Guards, who were
so useful in re-establishing order on the
two days after the abdication of Louis
Philippe, could no longer be depended on.
Paris would be in the possession of
the mob, and that mob is under the
direction of leaders composed of the
worst and the most unscrupulous of
demagogues.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The same correspondent adds:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“The financial and commercial crisis
which has created such ravages here for
the last week is rapidly extending. I
have already given you a distressing list
of private bankers who have been obliged
to suspend payment. Another bank,
though not one of any great name, was
spoken of yesterday as being on the eve
of bankruptcy; but on inquiry, I find
that the bank is still open this morning,
although it is doubtful if it will continue
so to the end of the day. I abstain from
mentioning the name. The commercial
world is just in as deep distress as the
financial world. <em>Every branch of trade
is paralysed.</em> It is useless to attempt to
give particular names or even trades. I
shall, therefore, only mention, that in one
branch of trade, which is generally considered
one of the richest in France,
namely, the metal trade, there is an almost
total suspension of payments. It is not
that the traders have not property, but
that they cannot turn it into cash. They
have acceptances to meet, and they have
acceptances in hand, but they cannot pay
what is due by them, for they cannot get
what others owe. In short, <em>trade is paralysed</em>,
for the medium by which it is
ordinarily carried on has disappeared. In
other trades precisely the same circumstances
occur; but I only mention this
one trade as showing the position of all
others. How long is this to last? No
one can say; but one thing certain is,
that no symptom of amelioration has
hitherto shown itself.”—<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>,
March 20.</p>

<p class='c016'>As the experiment now making
in France is new, and in the highest
degree important, so it is to the
last degree to be wished that it
may go on <em>undisturbed</em>. The other
powers of Europe cannot be too much
on their guard against it; but no
armed intervention should be attempted,
if France retains the pacific
attitude she has hitherto held in
regard to other states. The republicans
of that country have never
ceased to declare that the first Revolution
terminated in internal bloodshed,
military despotism, and foreign subjugation,
because it was not let alone—because
the Girondists plunged it
into war, in order to provide a vent
for the ardent passions and vehement
aspirations of the unemployed multitudes
in that country. Lamartine admits,
in his celebrated circular, that in
1792 “war was a necessity to France.”
He disclaims, as every man of the
least knowledge on the subject must
do, the idea that it was provoked by
the European powers, who, it is historically
known, were drawn into it
when wholly unprepared, and as unwillingly
as a conscientious father of
a family is forced into a duel. Lamartine
says the same necessity no
longer exists—that the world has
become pacific, and that internal
regeneration, not foreign conquest, is
the end of this revolution. We hope
it is so. We are sure it is ardently
desired in this country that pacific
relations should not be disturbed with
the great republic, provided she keeps
within her own territory, and does
not seek to assuage her thirst at
foreign fountains. By all means let
the long wished-for experiment be
made. Let it be seen how society can
get on without the direction of property
and knowledge. Let it be seen
into what sort of state the doctrines
of the Socialists and St Simonians,
the dictates of the trades-unions, the
clamour of the working masses, will
speedily reduce society. Theirs be
the glory and the honour if the experiment
succeeds—theirs the disgrace
and the obloquy if it fails. Let all
other nations stand aloof, and witness
the great experiment—“a clear stage
and no favour” be the universal
maxim. But let every other people
abstain from imitating the example,
<em>till it is seen how the experiment has
succeeded in the great parent republic</em>.
It will be time enough to follow its
footsteps when experience has proved
it is conducive to human happiness
and social stability.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while, as ardently as any Socialist
in existence, we deprecate the
commencement of hostilities by any
European power, and earnestly desire
to see the great social experiment
now making in France brought to a
pacific issue, in order that its practicability
and expedience may for ever
be determined among men, yet it is
evident that things <em>may</em> take a different
issue in that country. It is
possible—though God forbid we
should say it is probable—that the
great republic may, from internal suffering,
be driven to foreign aggression.
This, on Lamartine’s own admission,
has happened once: it may happen
twice. France has four hundred
thousand regular troops under arms;
and every man capable of bearing a
musket is to be forthwith enrolled
in the National Guard. Twenty-five
thousand of that body have already
been taken into regular and permanent
pay, at thirty sous, or about
fifteenpence, a-day, and sent to the
frontier. It is impossible to say how
soon this immense and excited mass,
with arms in their hands, and little
food in their stomachs, may <em>drive</em> the
government, as in 1792 they did that
of the Girondists, on Lamartine’s
admission, into foreign warfare. It
behoves Europe to be on its guard.
Fortunately the course which its governments
should pursue in such an
event lies clear and open. They have
only to resume the Treaty of Chaumont,
concluded in 1813, to curb the
ambition of the great military republic
of which Napoleon was the head. Let
that treaty be secretly but immediately
renewed as a purely <em>defensive
league</em>. Let no one think of attacking
France; but the moment that France
invades any other power, let the four
great powers forthwith bring a hundred
and fifty thousand each into the
field. Let not the wretched mistake
be again committed, of the others
looking tamely on when one is assailed—“et
dum singuli pugnant,
universi vincuntur.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The moment
the French cross the Rhine or the
Alps, the states of Europe must stand
side by side as they did at Leipsic
and Waterloo, if they would avoid
another long period of oppression by
the conquering republicans.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nearly sixty years have elapsed
since Mr Burke observed—“The age
of chivalry is gone; that of sophists,
economists, and calculators has succeeded,
and the glory of Europe is
extinguished for ever. Never more
shall we behold that generous loyalty
to rank and sex—that proud submission,
that dignified obedience, that
subordination of the heart, which kept
alive, even in servitude itself, the
spirit of an exalted freedom. The
unbought grace of life—the cheap
defence of nations, the nurse of manly
sentiments—is gone. It is gone, that
sensibility of principle, that chastity
of honour, which felt a stain like a
wound, which inspired courage while
it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled
whatever it touched, and under which
vice itself lost half of its evil, by losing
all its grossness.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> What a
commentary on these well-known
and long-admired words have recent
events afforded! It is indeed gone,
the loyalty to rank and sex—the
proud submission, the dignified obedience,
the <em>subordination of the heart</em>,
which formerly characterised and
adorned the states of modern Europe.
With more courage than the German
Empress, the Duchess of Orleans
fronted the revolutionary mob in the
Chamber of Deputies; but no swords
leapt from their scabbards in the
Chamber of Deputies when her noble
appeal was made to the loyalty of
France—no generous hearts found
vent in the words, “Moriamur pro
rege nostro, Maria Theresa!” It could
no longer be said—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The infuriated rabble pointed their
muskets at the royal heroine, and
the few loyal members of the assembly
were glad to purchase her safety by
removing her from the disgraceful
scene. Not a shot was thereafter
fired; not a show even of resistance
to the plebeian usurpation was made.
An army of four hundred thousand
men, five hundred thousand National
Guards, thirty-four millions of men,
in a moment forgot their loyalty,
broke their oaths, and surrendered
their country to the worst of tyrannies,
the tyranny of a multitude of tyrants.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The unbought grace of life,” says
Mr Burke, “the <em>cheap defence of
nations</em>, is at an end.” What a commentary
has the triumph of the
Barricades, the government of Louis
Philippe, afforded on these words!
M. Garnier Pages, in his Financial
Report, has unfolded the state of the
French finances, the confusion and
disastrous state of which he is fain to
ascribe to the prodigal expenditure
and unbounded corruption of Louis
Philippe. He tells us, and we doubt
not with truth, that during the seventeen
years of his government, the
expenditure has been raised from
900,000,000 francs, (£36,000,000,) to
1700,000,000 francs, (£68,000,000;)
that the debt has been increased during
that period by £64,000,000; and
that the nation was running, under
his direction, headlong into the gulf
of national bankruptcy. He observes,
with a sigh, how moderate in comparison,
how cheap in expenditure, and
pacific in conduct, was the government
of Charles X., which never
brought its expenditure up to
£40,000,000. It is all true—it is
what we predicted eighteen years ago
would be the inevitable result of a democratic
revolt; it is the consummation
we invariably predicted of the transports
following the fall of Charles X.
The republicans, now so loud in reprobation
of the expenditure of the Citizen
King, forget that his throne was of their
own making; that he was a successful
democratic usurper; that his power
was established to the sound of the
shouts of the republicans in all Europe,
amidst the smoke of the Barricades.
A usurping government is necessarily
and invariably more costly than a
legitimate one; because, having lost
the loyalty of the heart, it has no
foundation to rest on, but the terrors
of the senses, or the seductions of interest.
It was for precisely the same
reason that William III. in ten years
raised the expenditure of Great Britain
from £1,800,000 a year, to £6,000,000;
and that, in the first twenty years of
the English government subsequent
to the Revolution, the national debt
had increased from £600,000 to
£54,000,000. When the moral and
cheap bond of loyalty is broken,
government has no resource but an
appeal to the passions or interests of
the people. The Convention tried an
appeal to their republican passions,
and they brought on the Reign of
Terror. Napoleon tried an appeal to
their military passions, and he brought
on the subjugation of France by
Europe. Louis Philippe, as the only
remaining resource, appealed to their
selfish interests, and he induced the
revolution of 1848. Mankind cannot
escape from the gentle influence of
moral obligations, but to fall under
the reaction of conquest, the debasement
of corruption, or the government
of force.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all these governments, say the
republicans, fell, because they departed
from the principles of the Revolution,
and because they became
corrupted by power as soon as they
had tasted its sweets. But even supposing
this were true,—supposing
that Mirabeau, Danton, Robespierre,
Napoleon, and Louis Philippe were
all overthrown, not because they took
the only method left open to them to
preserve the support of the senators,
but because they departed from the
principles of the Revolution; do the
republicans not see that the very announcement
of that fact is the most decisive
condemnation of their system of
government? Do they expect to find
liberals more eloquent than Mirabeau,
republicans more energetic than
Danton, socialists more ardent than
Robespierre, generals more capable
than Napoleon, citizen kings more
astute than Louis Philippe? Republican
power must be committed
to some one. Mankind cannot exist
an hour without a government: the
first act of the infuriated and victorious
rabble in the Chamber of
Deputies was to name a Provisional
one. But if experience has
proved that intellect the most
powerful, patriotism the most ardent,
genius the most transcendent, penetration
the most piercing, experience
the most extensive, are invariably
shipwrecked amidst the temptations
and the shoals of newly acquired republican
power, do they not see
that it is not a form of government
adapted for the weakness of humanity;
and that if the leaders of revolution
are not impelled to destruction by an
external and overbearing necessity,
they are infallibly seduced into it by
the passions which, amidst the novelty
of newly acquired power, arise in
their own breasts? In either case,
a revolution government must terminate
in its own destruction,—in
private sufferings and public disasters;
and so it will be with the
government of M. Lamartine and that
of the new National Assembly, as it
has been with all those which have
preceded it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deus patiens,” says St Augustin,
“quia æternus.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a>—What an awful
commentary on this magnificent text
have recent events afforded! Eighteen
years ago Louis Philippe forgot his
loyalty and broke his oath; the first
prince of the blood elevated himself
to power by successful treason; he
adopted, if he did not make, a revolution.
He sent his lawful monarch
into exile; he prevented the placing
the crown on the head of his grandson;
he for ever severed France from its
lawful sovereigns. What has been
the result of his usurpation? Where
are now his enduring projects, his
family alliances, his vast army, his
consolidated power? During seventeen
years he laboured with indefatigable
industry and great ability to
establish his newly acquired authority,
and secure, by the confirmation of his
own power, the perpetual exile of the
lawful sovereign of France. Loud and
long was the applause at first bestowed
by the liberal party in Europe on the
usurpation; great was the triumph of
the bourgeoisie in every state at seeing
a lawful monarch overturned by
a well-concerted urban revolt, and the
National converted into a Prætorian
Guard, which could dispose of crowns
at pleasure. But meanwhile the justice
of Heaven neither slumbered nor
slept. The means taken by Louis
Philippe to consolidate his power, and
which were in truth the only ones
that remained at his disposal, consummated
his ruin. His steady adherence
to peace dissatisfied the
ardent spirits which sought for war;
his firm internal government disconcerted
the republicans; his vast internal
expenditure drew after it a
serious embarrassment of finance.
He could not appeal to the loyal feelings
of the generous, for he was a
usurper; he could not rest on the
support of the multitude, for they
would have driven the state to
ruin; he could not rally the army
round his throne, for they would have
impelled him into war. Thus he
could rest only on the selfish interests;
and great was the skill with which he
worked on that powerful principle in
human affairs. But a government
which stands on selfish feelings alone
is a castle built on sand; the first
wind of adversity levels it with the
dust. Napoleon’s throne was founded
on this principle, for he sacrificed to
warlike selfishness; Louis Philippe
on the same, for he sacrificed to pacific
selfishness. Both have undergone
the stern but just law of retribution.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth, has been meted out to both.
To Napoleon, who had sent so many
foreign princes into banishment, and
subverted so many gallant states, a
defeat in the field, a melancholy exile,
and unbefriended death, in a foreign
land; to Louis Philippe, who had
dethroned his lawful sovereign, and
carried the standard of treason into
the halls of the Tuilleries, the fate
which he allotted to Charles X., that
of being expelled with still greater
ignominy from the <em>same halls</em>, being
compelled to eat the bread of the
stranger, and see his dynasty driven
from their usurped throne amidst the
derision and contempt of mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If absolute power,” says M. De
Tocqueville, “shall re-establish itself
in whatever hands, in any of the democratic
states of Europe, I have no
doubt it will assume a form unknown
to our fathers. When the great families
and the spirit of clanship prevailed,
the individual who had to
contend with tyranny never found himself
alone—he was supported by his
clients, his relations, his friends. But
when the estates are divided, and races
confounded, where shall we find the
spirit of family? What form will remain
in the influences of habit among
a people changing perpetually, where
every act of tyranny will find a precedent
in previous disorders, where
every crime can be justified by an example;
where nothing exists of sufficient
antiquity to render its destruction
an object of dread, and nothing
can be figured so new that men are
afraid to engage in it? What resistance
would manners afford which have
already received so many shocks?
What would public opinion do, when
twenty persons do not exist bound together
by any common tie; when you
can no more meet with a man, a family,
a body corporate, or a class of
society, which could represent or act
upon that opinion; where each citizen
is equally poor, equally impotent,
equally isolated, <em>and can only oppose
his individual weakness to the organised
strength of the Central Government</em>?
To figure any thing equal <span class='fss'>TO THE DESPOTISM</span>
which would then be established
amongst us, we would require
to recur not to our own annals; we
would be forced to go back to those
frightful periods of tyranny, when,
manners being corrupted, old recollections
effaced, habits destroyed, opinions
wavering, liberty deprived of its
asylum under the laws, men made a
sport of the people, and princes wore
out the clemency of heaven rather
than the patience of their subjects.
They are blind indeed who look for
democratic equality in the monarchy
of Henry IV. and Louis XIV.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> What
a commentary on this terrible prophecy
have recent events supplied!
The revolutionists say, that France is
entering the last phase of the revolution.—It
is true, it is entering it; but
it is the last phase of punishment
to which it is blindly hurrying. The
sins of the fathers are about to be
visited on the third generation. To
talk of real freedom, stable institutions,
protected industry, social happiness,
in such a country, is out of the
question. With their own hands, in
the first great convulsion, they destroyed
all the bulwarks of freedom
in the land, and nothing remains to
them, after the madness of socialism
has run its course, but the equality of
despotism. They have thrown off
the laws of God and man, and Providence
will leave their punishment to
their own hands. “The Romans,”
says Gibbon, “aspired to be equal:
they were levelled <em>by the equality of
Asiatic bondage</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Amidst so many mournful subjects
of contemplation, there is one consideration
which forces itself upon the
view, of great importance in the
present condition of this country.
This revolution in France being a
revolt of labour against capital, its
first principle is a <em>deadly hostility to
the principle of free-trade</em>. The recent
barbarous expulsion of the English
labourers from France, several thousands
in number, after having enriched
the country by their labour, and
taught it by their example, proves
what sympathy foreign industry meets
with from the great and <em>fraternising</em>
republic. The confiscation of their
hard-won earnings by the cessation
of the savings’ banks to pay more
than a tenth in cash, shows what they
have to expect from the justice and
solvency of its government. With
the rise of the communist and socialist
party in France to power, whose
abomination is capital, whose idol is
labour, it may with certainty be predicted
that the <em>sternest and most
unbending prohibition of British goods
will immediately be adopted by the
great philanthropic and fraternising
republic</em>. All other countries which
follow in any degree the example of
the great parent republic, by the
popularising of their institutions, will,
from the influence of the labour party,
do the same. America already draws
nineteen million dollars, or nearly
£4,000,000 sterling, from its imports,
the greater part of which is a direct
tax levied on the industry of this
country. Reciprocity, always one-sided,
will ere long be absolutely isolated.
We shall be,</p>

      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Penitus divisos orbe Britannos</span>,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>even more by our policy than our
situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>What chance there is of free-trade
doctrines being adopted by the present
socialist and free-trade government in
France, may be judged of by the following
quotation from the <cite><span lang="fr">Constitutionnel</span></cite>:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is not, in fact, the consumer, such as
the free-traders represent him to us, a
strange creation? He is, as he has been
wittily described, a fantastic being—a
monster who has a mouth and a stomach
to consume produce, but who has neither
legs to move nor arms to work. We do
not fear that the operative classes will
suffer themselves to be seduced by those
doctrines. We are aware that they have
constantly rejected them through the
organs of the press more especially
charged with the defence of their interests;
but it behoves them likewise that
the Provisional Government should remain
on its guard against principles
which <em>would be still more disastrous under
existing circumstances</em>. M. Bethmont, the
minister of commerce, has declared, in a
letter addressed by him to the association
for the defence of national labour, that
he would never grant facilities of which
the consequences would be calculated to
injure our manufacturers. We see by
this declaration that the dispositions of
the Provisional Government are good.
The very inquiry which is now being held
to devise means to ameliorate the moral
and material condition of the operatives,
ought to confirm the government in the
necessity of maintaining the system <em>which
protects industry</em>. Let us inquire what
the consequence would be, in fact, if we
were so imprudent as to suffer foreign
produce to enter France free of duty.
Political economy teaches us that wages
find their balance in consequence of the
competition existing between nations;
but they find their equilibrium by falling,
and not by rising. If that were not the
case, there would be no possibility of
maintaining the struggle. Now, if we
opened our ports, this cruel necessity
would become the more imperious for
us, as, being placed opposite to England
in conditions of inferiority, greater in
respect to capital, to the means of transport,
and to the price of matters of the
first necessity, we could not redeem those
disadvantages except by a reduction of
wages. This, in fact, would be the annihilation
of the operative.”—<cite><span lang="fr">Constitutionnel</span></cite>,
March 16, 1848.</p>

<p class='c016'>This is the inevitable result of
republican and socialist triumph in
the neighbouring kingdom, and the
impulse given to liberal institutions,
an inlet thereby opened to manufacturing
jealousy all over the world.
Debarred thus from all possibility of
reciprocal advantages; shut out for
ever from the smallest benefit in return,
is it expedient for Great Britain
to continue any longer her concessions
to foreign industry, or incur the blasting
imputation of a suicidal policy
towards her own inhabitants in favour
of ungrateful and selfish foreigners,
who meet concessions with prohibition,
and industrial teaching with savage
expulsion from the instructed
territory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No revolution,” says Madame de
Staël, “can succeed in any country,
unless it is headed by a portion of the
higher, and the majority of the middle
classes.” Recent events have afforded
another to the many confirmations
which history affords of this
important observation. Had the
National Guard of Paris stood firm,
the troops of the line would never
have wavered; the government would
not have been intimidated; a socialist
revolution would have been averted;
public credit preserved; the savings’
bank, the place of deposit of the poor—the
public funds, the investment of the
middle classes—saved from destruction.
When we contemplate the
dreadful monetary crisis which has
been brought on in France by the revolution;
when we behold the bank of
France suspending payments, and all
the chief banks of the metropolis rendered
bankrupt by the shock; when we
behold wealth in ship-loads flying from
its menaced shores, and destitution in
crowds stalking through its crowded
and idle streets, we are struck
with horror, and impressed with a
deeper sense of thankfulness at the
good sense and patriotic spirit of the
middle classes in this country, which
has so quickly crushed the efforts of
the seditious to involve us in similar
calamities. “The unbought loyalty
of men,—the cheap defence of nations,”—still,
thank God! subsists
amongst us. The poison of infidelity
has not destroyed the moral
bonds of society—the rolling-stone of
revolution has not crushed the institutions
of freedom amongst us. There
are hearts to love their country—arms
to defend their Queen—not less among
our civil than our military defenders.
The pillage of Glasgow on the first
outbreak of the disturbances there,
their speedy suppression, by the energy
of the inhabitants, has not been lost
on the empire. It is not in vain that
twenty thousand constables came forward
to be enrolled in one day in
Glasgow, and eleven thousand in
Manchester. We see what we have
to expect from the seditious; they
see what they have to expect from
the middle classes of society, and
the whole virtuous part of the lower.
With such dispositions in both,
Great Britain may be exposed to
local disorder or momentary alarm,
but it can never be seriously endangered,
or undergo that worst of horrors—a
social revolution. Nor will she,
with such dispositions in her people,
be less prepared to assert the ancient
glory of her arms, should circumstances
render that alternative necessary.
She has no internal reforms
to make that she cannot achieve
peaceably, by the means which her
constitution affords. Her giant strength
slumbers, not sleeps. Our ships of
war, in the noble words of Mr Canning,
“how soon one of those stupendous
masses, now reposing on
their shadows in perfect stillness,—how
soon, upon any call of patriotism,
or of necessity, it would
assume the likeness of an animated
thing, instinct with life and motion—how
soon it would ruffle, as it were,
its swelling plumage—how quickly
it would put forth all its beauty and
its bravery, collect its scattered elements
of strength, and awaken its
dormant thunder!”—how soon would
the flag of Waterloo again be unfurled
to the breeze!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>MY ROUTE INTO CANADA.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c022'>NO. II.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Lake Champlain was long known
to the Dutch, and through them to the
English, as the Lake of Corlaer. It
seems that one Corlaer was for a long
time the great man of a little Dutch
settlement on the Mohawk, where for
many years he swayed the civic sword
so potently and with such terror to
evil-doers among the Indians, that
they adopted his name into their language
to signify a white governor.
This doughty Dutchman, therefore, left
the title to his successors, and the
Corlaers went through their decline
and fall with as much dignity, in a
small way, as history ascribes to the
Pharaohs and the Cæsars. Like the
founders of other dynasties, however,
the original Van Corlaer came to a
remarkable and tragic end; and as
this deplorable event took place on the
Lake, now known by the name of
Champlain, the Dutch stubbornly
regarded their own hero as having
the best right to name it. For a time
it seemed likely that fortune would
decide for the Dutch; but, with a
fickleness for which the flirt is proverbial,
she suddenly declared for the
French claim; and time having ratified
the award, the name of Corlaer is
no more heard among mortals, except
when some one of antiquarian tastes,
like myself, discovers, with a meditative
sigh, that it once could start a
ghost as soon as Cæsar, and come
very near being “writ in water,”
which, strange to say, would have
rendered it immortal.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems that in those days there
was, somewhere in the lake, a remarkable
rock which the Mohawks regarded
as the dome of a submarine palace, in
which dwelt with his mermaids a
wicked old Indian enchanter, who
ruled over Boreas and Euroclydon.
The superstition was quite coincident
in its particulars with the more classical
and familiar one which is served
up in the story of Æneas: but this
mischievous king of the winds had the
merit of being easily propitiated; and
the Indians, as they timidly passed
his stronghold, never failed to send
down to him the tributary peace offering
of a pipe, an arrow, or any thing
else, save their bottles of fire-water,
of which the old fellow was dexterously
cheated. The doughty Van
Corlaer, undertaking a voyage to the
north, was duly informed of these
facts; but he swore “by stone and
bone” that he would not pay the
tribute, or ask any one’s permission to
navigate the lake. I am sorry to add
that he would not be argued out of
his rash and inconsiderate vow. Tradition
relates that, as he approached
the rock, his mariners showed signs
of fear, which appeared so puerile and
idle to the enlarged soul of the hero,
that he on the contrary steered close
to the fearful citadel, and, shamefully
exposing his person, made an unseemly
gesture towards the abode of
the Indian Æolus, and added some
Dutch formula of defiance. It is
almost needless to relate that the
wrath of his ventose majesty was
greatly excited. He scorned, indeed,
to make a tempest about it; but despatching
several angry little squalls
after the insolent admiral, they bored
him fore and aft, and beset him from
so many quarters at once, in a narrow
gorge of the lake, that, in short, he
was effectually swamped, and thus
made a warning example to all succeeding
Van Corlaers. His name, as
I said, was for a while bequeathed to
the lake; but even this poor recompense
for a disaster so terrible has
proved as evanescent as the bubbles,
in which the last sigh of the unfortunate
Dutchman came up from the caves
to which, like the great Kempenfelt,
he went down in a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lake, therefore, retains its
Gallic appellation, and preserves the
name and memory of Samuel de
Champlain, a servant of Henry IV.,
and justly surnamed the father of <i><span lang="fr">La
Nouvelle France</span></i>. The expedition in
which it first received his name was a
romantic one, and so well illustrates
what I have already said of the border
feuds of the seventeenth century, that
I must be excused for relating its
story. Champlain had come down to
the shores of the lake with a party of
Adirondacks, and was advancing
through the forest towards the lands
of the Iroquois, when suddenly they
came in sight of a strong party of
that nation, who showed no disposition
to decline an encounter. On the
contrary, setting up their warwhoop,
they advanced pell-mell to the attack.
The Frenchmen, betaking themselves
to an ambuscade, made ready to receive
them with their fusils; while
their savage allies awaited the foe
with their usual coolness and contempt
of danger. The Iroquois were
the more numerous, and, elated by
their apparent superiority, came down
with the sweeping violence of a whirlwind.
The Adirondacks seemed in
their eyes as chaff; and with howls
and hatchets they were just pouncing
upon their prey, when the blazing
fusils of Champlain and his comrades
laid the foremost of the Iroquois warriors
in the dust. The remainder fled
into the wilderness with the most
frantic outcries of astonishment and
despair. It was the first volley of
fire-arms that ever reached the ear or
the heart of an Iroquois—the first
that ever startled the echoes of that
lake, which was so soon destined to
tremble beneath the bellowing thunders
of navies. They were defeated
they knew not how; but they retired
to the depths of the forest, muttering
the deadliest vows of revenge. It so
happened that another collision of the
same kind occurred soon after on the
Saurel—a little river, much broken by
rapids, through which the waters of
the lake make their way to the sea.
There was among the Algonquins a
bold and dashing chief whose name
was Pisquaret. He had made an incursion
against the Iroquois, and was
laden with the scalps which he had
taken from an Indian village which he
surprised at night and completely destroyed.
As he was navigating the
rapids of the Saurel with his Adirondacks
and several Frenchmen, he was
surprised by a powerful armament of
Iroquois, who immediately bore down
upon him, with great advantage from
the current. The treacherous Algonquins
feigned to give themselves up
for lost, and, setting up the death-song
of the Adirondacks, appeared to await
their inevitable fate. The Frenchmen,
throwing themselves flat in the
batteaux, and resting the muzzles of
their carbines upon the gunnels,
coolly calculated the effects of the
coming discharge; but Pisquaret and
his warriors raised their voices in
chanting the victories of their tribe,
inflaming the Iroquois by vaunts of
injuries which they had done them,
and defying them in return not to
spare any torture in seeing how the
Algonquins could die. The exasperated
foe was just pealing the war-cry,
when the deadly blaze of the
carbines changed their exultation in
a moment to howls of agony and dismay.
But these were tricks which
could not be repeated; and, long after,
the empire of the Grande Monarque
paid dearly for these frolics in the
unpruned wilderness. Those who
are fond of tracing the greatest political
events and changes to accidents
inconsiderable in themselves, have
maintained that the first volley of
fire-arms that startled the echoes of
Lake Champlain, decided the fate
and fixed the limits of French dominion
in America. Nor is this theory
to be lightly dismissed as fanciful; for
it cannot be doubted that the subsequent
spread of the Anglo-Saxon race
over the hunting-grounds of the
Mohawks, and through them to the
further west, was owing to the favourable
treaties which the English were
able to effect with the Iroquois in
the days of their power,—treaties
which, had they been secured by the
French, would have opened the whole
region now called New York to their
countrymen, and filled it with a mongrel
population under the absolute
control of Jesuits and political adventurers.
Nor can any thing be
ascertained more decisive of what was
at first a game and a problem, than
the collisions I have described. The
Iroquois soon found out the secret of
their discomfiture, and associated the
name of a Frenchman with that of
the Algonquins in their inveterate
hatred. And when they in turn found
Pale-faces to seek their alliance, and
supply them with arms, they became
the barrier of British enterprise against
the encroachments of France; and so
it was that the beautiful vale of Mohawk,
the shores of Erie and Ontario,
and the rugged mountains of Vermont,
came to be filled with the sons
of Englishmen, and not with the
dwarfish overgrowth of the French
Canadian provinces. The laws, civil
institutions, and the religion of England
thus found a footing in that great
territory, which, as more or less influencing
all the other members of the
American confederacy, is called the
empire state:—and perhaps the bells
that ring for the English service
throughout that region would have
been tolling for the Latin mass, but
for those early encounters on the
shores of Lake Champlain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our delay at Whitehall was owing to
a blunder of Freke’s. He had assured us
that we would certainly arrive in time
to take the steamer down the lake to
St John’s; but it had been several
hours on its way when we arrived at
the inn. Since the burning of a
steamer several years before, there had
been but one on these waters; and as
it was now on its downward trip, it
could not again leave Whitehall for
several days. Here was a pretty
mess for some half-dozen of us!</p>

<p class='c009'>There was nothing for us but bedtime;
and poor enough beds it brought
us. I was up before the sun had
found a chance to send a squint into
the town over its rocky eastern wall;
and I wonder not that the sun is slow
to visit it, for it is altogether a disagreeable
hole. For this I was unprepared.
Whitehall hath a royal
prestige, and the notion of the head of
a lake had given me the pleasing expectation
of a picturesque little harbour,
and a romantic water view.
There is nothing of the sort. The
harbour is well called the basin; and
Wood-creek, the canal, and the lake,
just here, are all ditches together.
Vessels of different sorts and sizes lie
huddled and crowded at their confluence,
and the waters are precisely
of the colour of <i><span lang="fr">café-au-lait</span></i>! Shade
of merry Charles, how came they to
change Skenesborough into Whitehall?</p>

<p class='c009'>I have compared the ditch-water to
<i><span lang="fr">café-au-lait</span></i>; but all I can say of my
breakfast is, that its coffee was not
comparable to ditch-water. Freke
was despatched to look us out a vessel
willing to take us any where, for staying
here was out of the question. He
had given us the Indian name of the
place as <em>Kaw-ko-kaw-na</em>, assuring us
that this euphonious polysyllable was
good Iroquois for <em>the place where they
catch fish</em>. This little item of knowledge
proved to us a dangerous thing,
for it suggested a fishing excursion to
fill up the hours of Freke’s anticipated
absence. We rowed ourselves for
some distance along a narrow channel,
with marshes on both sides, which
looked like the stronghold of that cohort
of agues and fevers which, since
the days of Prometheus, have delighted
in burning and shaking the
race of mortals. Wood-creek throws
itself into the basin with a foaming
cataract of waters; and beyond the
marshes are precipitous walls of rocks,
that confine the view. These rocks
they call the Heights; and I doubt not
they would look well at a distance,
but the mischief is, there is no viewing
them in so favourable a way. They
rise like a natural Bastile, and so near
your nose, that your only prospect is
perpendicular; and you are consequently
obliged to think more of your
nose than the prospect. In the moonlight,
the evening before, I did think
there was something magnificent
about the Heights; but this impression,
like other visions of the night, did not
survive the daybreak. I should think
a geologist or a stone-mason might
find them interesting; and an unprincipled
inhabitant of Whitehall, out of
patience with life in such a place, or
emulous of the Lesbian Sappho, would
doubtless find them suitable to the nefarious
purpose of breaking his neck.
This is all I can say for them; and as
for the fishing excursion, we soon gave
it up, and paddled back to the quay,
out of patience with Freke for his
instructions in Indian philology, and
heartily tired of attempting to catch
fish in Kaw-ko-kaw-na.</p>

<p class='c009'>Freke, for once in his life, had been
employed to some purpose. He met
us on the quay, and immediately conducted
us to a gay little sloop, to which
he had already transferred our luggage,
and which was ready for a start down
the lake to Plattsburgh. We were
introduced to a raw-boned, barethroated
Vermonter as “Captain
Pusher,” and, ratifying the bargain of
our commissary, were soon snugly on
board his vessel; of which I regret
that I forget the name, though I distinctly
remember the letters that shone
on the painted sterns we passed—such
as the Macdonough, the Congress,
the Green-Mountain-Boy, and the
Lady of the Lake. Whatever was its
name, its deck contained several baskets
of vegetables and joints of meat,
which gave us promise of a good dinner;
and scarcely were we under
weigh, before Sambo the cook began
to pare turnips, and grin from ear to
ear over savoury collops of mutton,
which he was submitting to some incipient
process of cookery.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were favoured with a good
breeze; but the channel of which I
have spoken seemed to drag its length
like an Alexandrine. We reached a
place where it is so narrow, and makes
an angle so abrupt, that there is a contrivance
on the bank which steamers
are obliged to employ in turning. It
is best described by the name which
has been given to it by the sailors, from</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A pigmy scraper wi’ his fiddle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wha used at tryste and fairs to driddle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wi’ hand on haunch, and upward e’e.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>They call it the Fiddler’s Elbow; and
as it seems the limit of Whitehall, we
were glad to double the cape as speedily
as possible. A squadron of ducks that
were puddling in the dirty water of the
marshes gave point to a quotation from
Voltaire, with which one of our company
paid his parting compliments to
<em>Kaw-ko-kaw-na</em>, as its author did to
Holland—<i><span lang="fr">Adieu! canards, canailles,
canaux.</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'>After clearing this place, we found
an object of interest in the decaying
hulks of the two flotillas that came to
an engagement in Plattsburgh bay, in
the year 1814. The British and America
galleys lay there rotting together,
with many marks of the sharp action
in which they had well borne their part.
The more imposing proportions of Captain
Downie’s flag-ship the Confiance
arrested our particular attention. She
was a sheer hulk, charred and begrimed
by fire, and a verdant growth of grass
was sprouting from her seams and honourable
scars. A few years before,
she was a gallant frigate, cruising upon
the open lake, and bearing proudly
in the fight the red-cross of St George.
Her commander fell upon her deck in
the first moment of the action; and
after a fierce engagement, during which
she received 105 round-shot in her hull,
she was surrendered. There was
something in the sight of these rival
squadrons thus rotting side by side,
that might have inspired a moralist.
How many brave fellows that once
trode their decks were likewise mouldering
in the dust of death! But in
another view of the matter there was
something inspiring. They were a
witness of peace between the two nations
who hold Lake Champlain between
them; and long may it be before
either shall wish to recall them from
the nothingness into which they have
long since crumbled!</p>

<p class='c009'>The lake becomes gradually wider,
and though not remarkable for beauty,
affords scenes to engage the eye and
occupy the mind. It is rather river
scenery, than what we naturally associate
with lakes. On the left are the
mountain ridges that divide its waters
from those of Lake George; on
the right, is the rocky boundary of
Vermont. The lake occupies the
whole defile, lying very nearly due
north and south. As we approached
Ticonderoga, the region became more
mountainous, and the view was consequently
more attractive. Before us
on the east was Mount Independence,
and just opposite, on the west, rose
the bold height of Mount Defiance,
completely covering the fortress,
which we knew lurked behind it to
the north. By the help of a good
wind, we were not long in reaching the
spot where the outlet of Lake George
debouches. It comes into Lake Champlain,
apparently from the north-west,
at the foot of Mount Defiance; the
lake making a bend and winding
eastward; and between the lake and
the outlet, on a sloping and partially
wooded promontory of some hundred
feet in height, rise the rough but picturesque
ruins of Ticonderoga. They
present an appearance not usual in
American scenery; and having every
charm of association which Indian,
French, British, and patriotic warfare
can throw around such places, are
naturally enough endeared to Americans,
and gratifying to the curiosity
of travellers.</p>

<p class='c009'>This fortress was originally built by
the French, in 1756; and subsequently,
until the ascent of Mount
Defiance by Burgoyne proved its exposure
to attack on that point, it was
contested, captured, and recaptured,
and held by French, English, and
Americans, as a stronghold of mastery
and power. It commanded the avenue
to the Hudson, and the pass to
Lake George. The name Ticonderoga,
in which every ear must detect a significant
beauty, is said to denote, in
the Indian dialect, the noise of the
cataracts in the outlet; but the French
called the fort Carillon, and afterwards
Vaudreuil, in honour of one of
their governors in Acadie, the Marquis
de Vaudreuil. In 1757, when Montcalm
(who fell in the defence of Quebec
two years afterwards) was making
his expedition against the English forts
on Lake George, he remained at this
place awaiting that powerful reinforcement
of savages, whose treachery
and thirst for blood rendered the campaign
so lamentably memorable. To
one who stands, as I did, on that
beautiful peninsula, and surveys the
quiet scene of land and water—sails
betokening civilised commerce, and a
trading village in Vermont, exhibiting
every mark of prosperous thrift—it
seems incredible that within the lifetime
of persons yet surviving, that
very scene was alive with savage nations
who called it their own, and gave
it to whom they would; but of whom
nothing remains but wild traditions,
and the certainty that they have been.
Yet, only forty-three years before
British and American flotillas were
contending for this lake, in sight of a
village with spires, and with none
other than civilised arts of war, the
same waters were covered with two
hundred canoes of Nipistingues, Abnakis,
Amenekis, and Algonquins,
paddling their way to the massacre of
a British force in a fortress at the
head of Lake George. From Father
Roubaud, a Jesuit priest who accompanied
them, the particulars of that
expedition have been handed down.
He describes the savages as bedaubed
with green, yellow, and vermillion;
adorned with glistening ornaments,
the gifts of their allies; their heads
shaven, saving their scalp-locks, which
rose from their heads like crests, stiffened
with tallow, and decorated with
beads and feathers; their chiefs bedizened
with finery, and each nation
embarked under wild but appropriate
ensigns. Such were the Christians
with whom Father Roubaud travelled
as chaplain, and whom he led against
his fellow Christians like another
Peter the Hermit pursuing Turks. It
is the plague of Popery that it often
expends itself in inspiring the deepest
religious sentiment, without implanting
the least religious principle. The
Italian bandit kneels at a wayside
crucifix, to praise God and the Virgin
for the plunder he has taken with bloodshed;
the Irish priest, at the altar,
devotes to death his unoffending neighbours,
with the very lips which, as he
believes, have just enclosed the soul,
body, and divinity of the world’s Redeemer;
and the Jesuit missionary of
New France had no scruple in consecrating
with the most awful rites of
religion, an expedition whose object
was the scalps of baptised men, and
whose results were the massacre of
women and children. The holy father
himself is particular to relate the fact
that he celebrated a mass before the
embarkation, for the express purpose
of securing the Divine blessing, and he
compliments the fervour with which
the savages assisted at the solemnity!
He had described the English to them
as a race of blasphemers, and they, at
least, were not to blame for embarking
in the spirit of crusaders “against
black Pagans, Turks, and Saracens.”
Daily, for a whole week, as the armament
advanced, did the wily Jesuit
land them on one of the many isles
that gem the lower waters of Lake
Champlain, on purpose to renew the
august sacrament of the altar before
their eyes: and he describes these
savages as chanting the praises of
the Lamb of God, with a fervour from
which he augured the consummation of
their character as Christians. At the
end of a week, they descried with joy
the French lilies as they waved over
the walls of Carillon; and in order to
make their approach more imposing,
they immediately arranged their canoes
under their ensigns, and advanced
in battle array. From the height on
which I stood, Montcalm beheld his
allies, on a bright July morning, their
hatchets and tomahawks gleaming in
the sun; their standards and scalp-locks
fluttering in the breeze; and
their thousand paddles hurrying them
through the waves of that beautiful
water: such a sight as no eye will ever
see again. To a nobleman fresh from
the gallantries of Versailles, it must
have been a spectacle full of wild and
romantic interest; and the picture is
altogether such a one as any imagination
may delight to reproduce.
Yet, when we reflect that it is even
now but fourscore years and ten since
such a scene was a terrible reality,
how striking the reflection that it has
as absolutely vanished from the earth,
beyond the possibility of revival, as the
display of tournaments, and the more
formidable pageants of the Crusades.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following year an expedition
against this fort was made by the
gallant Abercrombie, who approached
it from Lake George, and endeavoured
to take it by storm. It is commonly
said that Lord Howe fell in this assault
before the walls; but in fact he fell
the day before, while leading an advanced
guard through the forest.
Ticonderoga was garrisoned by about
four thousand men—French, Canadians,
and Indians—and their entrenchments
were defended by almost
impregnable outworks. The British
troops nevertheless made the attack
with the greatest intrepidity, and in
spite of a murderous fire, forced their
way to the walls, and even scaled
them, to be immediately cut down.
But after repeated assaults, and the
loss of two thousand men, General
Abercrombie was forced to desist
from the attempt; and the French
kept the post for a time. It of course
became English in the following year,
when the French power in America was
destroyed by the taking of Quebec.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have already referred to its seizure
by the eccentric Ethan Allen, on the
breaking out of the American war in
1775. This officer was a native of
Vermont, who had been an infidel
preacher, and was notorious as the
editor of the first deistical publication
that ever issued from the American
press. The revolution was hardly
begun, when the province of Connecticut
gave him a commission to capture
Ticonderoga. With about three
hundred of his hardy “Green-mountain-boys,”
he was hastening
to the spot, when he fell in with
Arnold, bearing a similar commission
from Massachusetts. After some dispute
as to the command, Allen was
made leader, and Arnold his assistant.
They arrived by night on the Vermont
shore, opposite the fort. There they
found a lad who had been accustomed
to visit the fort every day with provisions
and pedlar’s wares, and
crossing by his directions, without
noise, they were shown a secret and
covered entrance into the fort itself.
Climbing up through this passage,
Allen led his men within the walls,
and drew them up in the area of the
fortress, having silenced and disarmed
the only sentry who guarded the
entrance. The commander of the
post, who hardly knew there was war,
was actually startled from his sleep,
by Allen’s demand for its surrender.
The drowsy officer inquired—“By
what authority?” And was answered
by Allen, half in banter and half in
bombastic earnest,—“In the name of
the Great Jehovah, and of the Continental
Congress!” To one in his
straits, with a sword at his naked
breast, such a reply, however unintelligible,
was sufficiently overpowering,
and the post was surrendered without
resistance. Its reduction in 1777, by
Burgoyne, has been already described;
but Ticonderoga is for ever endeared
to Americans from the fact, that the
flag of their independence was so early
given to the breeze from its summit.</p>

<p class='c009'>A guide, who called himself Enoch
Gold, led me over the ruins. He
pretended to have been with St Clair,
and to have seen Burgoyne and his
men on Mount Defiance. He showed
us the way through which Allen gained
his entrance, and took us down into
the vaults and magazines. A subterranean
apartment was shown as a
kitchen, and the old fellow declared he
had eaten bread hot out of its ovens.
We gave the <em>soi-disant</em> veteran the
liberal rewards of a hero; but I suspect
we were paying him for his imagination,
rather than for his hardships.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shadows of the fortress were
beginning to lengthen on the lake
before we returned to our bark. The
mountains of Vermont, which are
mostly well wooded, looked brightly
green in the broad sunshine, and
tempted us to wish we had time for
an excursion to their heights. It was
afterwards my happiness to go into
Vermont, on a visit to Lake Dunmore,
which lies among its mountains, and
supplies delicious fish. I found it
a truly Arcadian region, abounding
with streams and pasturages, and rich
in flocks and herds. It breeds a rugged
race of men, with some characteristics
decidedly Swiss. It is said, indeed,
that a Switzer, who had come to settle
in America, preferred these diminutive
Alps, with their lakes and mountaineer
population, to any other part of the
country; and, fixing his dwelling accordingly,
soon ceased to be home-sick,
and sigh at the <i><span lang="fr">ranz des vaches</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Crown Point, the twin sister of
Ticonderoga, is only ten miles beyond;
but we did not reach it as soon as we
had expected, for the wind had
changed, and we were obliged to tack.
Every now and then, the man at the
helm, which was our gallant captain
himself, would cry out,—“Heads!”
and the boom would come sweeping
across the deck, with woe to the head
that wore a hat, or did not bow soon
enough to save it. Several times I
expected to see our friend Freke carried
overboard bodily, and engulfed
like another Corlaer; for so profoundly
was he engaged with his cigar, as he
sat, or rather squatted, on the hatches,
that the captain’s monotonous warning
failed to alarm him till the whole
company had echoed “Heads!” and,
with other demonstrations of affectionate
solicitude, forced him to fall
on all-fours.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Crown Point the lake greatly
improves. The water appears much
clearer, and the width of the lake is
nearly if not quite fourfolded. It continues
to expand till it becomes ten or
twelve miles in breadth, and islands
begin to be numerous. To the northward
the higher peaks of the Green
Mountains stretch away with magnificent
outlines; and on the west, a
bleak and craggy range of hills, which
are said to harbour even yet the wolf
and the bear, approach, and then
recede from the shore. Here, as early
as 1731, the French built Fort Frederick,
as the first move towards the
seizure and claim of the whole surrounding
territory; and from this
point they made their bloody and
atrocious incursions into New England,
and towards the Mohawk, or
dismissed their hireling savages to do
it for them. The recesses of Fort
Frederick are believed to have rivalled
the dungeons of the Inquisition in
scenes of misery and crime. In its
gloomy cells were plotted the inhuman
massacres which drenched the American
settlements in blood. There, it
is said, the Indian butchers received
their commissions to burn, tomahawk,
and scalp; and there, in the presence
of Jesuit fathers, or at least with their
connivance, was the gleaming gold
counted down to the savages in return
for their infernal trophies of success;
the silvery locks of the aged colonist,
the clotted tresses of women, and the
crimsoned ringlets of the child. In
1759 this detestable hold of grasping
and remorseless tyranny was blown
up, and abandoned by the French to
General Amherst. Soon after, the
British Government began to erect a
fortification in the vicinity of the
ruins, and a noble work it was;
though it proved of no use at all, after
the enormous sum of two millions
sterling had been expended on its
walls of granite, and ditches blasted in
the solid rock. The exploits of Arnold
and Sir Guy Carleton in this
vicinity have been already described.
Since the close of the war of the Revolution,
the costly works at Crown Point
have been suffered to fall into decay;
and they are now piles of ruin, covered
with weeds, among which the red
berries of the sumach are conspicuously
beautiful in their time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though “Captain Pusher” made
a landing at this point to procure
a little milk for our tea, we did not
go ashore, and were soon on our way
once more with a freer prospect, and
perhaps with somewhat expanded
spirits. The setting sun, in the clear
climate of America, is in fair weather
almost always beautiful; and my
recollections of the rosy and purple
tints with which it adorned the
feathery flakes of cloud that floated
around the peaks of the Green Mountains,
are to this day almost as bright
in memory as when they first made
my heart leap up to behold them in
the soft summer sky of Vermont. As
the lake grew wider and the darkness
deeper, there was of course
less and less to be seen; and the
noble scenery at Burlington, where
the width of the lake is greatest,
and the shores assume a bolder and
higher character of beauty, was to
our great regret unavoidably passed
in the night. Still, there is something
in starlight upon the waters, in
new and romantic regions, which peculiarly
inspires me. The same constellations
which one has long been
accustomed to view in familiar scenes
and associations, come out like old
friends in the heavens of strange and
untried lands; shining witnesses to
the brotherhood of differing nations,
and to the impartial benevolence and
unsleeping love of God. But I
have no reason to regret that the only
night I ever passed on Lake Champlain
was mostly spent in watching;
for long before I was tired of gazing
at Orion and the Pleiads, I was rewarded
by the sight of one of the
most splendid auroras that I ever beheld.
In a moment, the whole
northern heaven was illuminated with
columnar light; and the zenith seemed
to rain it down, so to speak—while
the surface of the lake reflecting it,
gave us, to our own eyes, the appearance
of sailing in some bright fluid,
midway between a vault and an abyss
of fire. This display of glory continued
to flash and quiver above us
for several hours. There were, in
quick succession, sheets and spires
and pencils of variegated light, rolling
and tremulous, wavy and flame-like,
blazoning heaven’s azure with something
like heraldic broidery and
colours. Towards morning, the intense
cold and heavy mountain dews
drove me for a season to my berth;
but I was on deck again in time to
see the moon make her heliacal rising
over the eastern peaks, in the wan
paleness of her last quarter. The
approach of day was attended with
a fog; but it soon thinned off, and we
made Plattsburgh in good time. Here
we parted with our vessel, and her
worthy commander; and though we
neither gave him a piece of plate nor
voted him an accomplished gentleman,
we left him with such wishes as,
if they have been fulfilled, have long
since removed him from the helm of
his sloop, and the waters of Lake
Champlain, to a snug little cot at Burlington,
and the company of any number
of rosy little Green-Mountain boys
and their interesting mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plattsburgh is situated on the western
bank of the lake, just where the
crescent shore of a bold peninsula
begins to curve round a broad semicircular
bay, several miles in circumference,
and of liberal depth. Here
the American squadron, under Commodore
Macdonough, was anchored
on the 11th of September 1814, in
order to assist the land forces under
General Macomb, in repelling an
expected attack from the British
troops under Sir George Prevost.
The English flotilla had been ordered
up from the Isle-aux-Noix to engage
Macdonough, and divert his fire from
the shore; and accordingly, at about
eight o’clock in the morning, was seen
off the peninsula of Cumberland Head,
and hailed by both armies with vociferous
acclamations. The cannonade
instantly began from the ships and on
the land, and for two hours and twenty
minutes the naval engagement was continued
with the most stubborn resolution
on both sides. Though the battle on
shore was sorely contested, the action
between the squadrons was anxiously
watched by both armies, and by thousands
of deeply interested spectators,
who surveyed the field and the fleets
from the neighbouring heights. Macdonough’s
flag-ship, the Saratoga, was
twice on fire; and though Downie had
fallen in the first moment of the conflict,
the Confiance had succeeded in
dismantling all the starboard guns of
her antagonist, when the bower-cable
of the Saratoga was cut, and a stern-anchor
dropped, on which she rounded
to, and presented a fresh broadside.
The Confiance was unable to imitate
this manœuvre, and she was obliged
to strike, the remainder of the flotilla
soon following her example. A few
of the British galleys escaped, but as
there was not another mast standing
in either fleet, they could neither be
followed by friends or by foes. The
decision of the contest was vociferously
cheered from the shore; and Sir
George, perceiving the fate of his fleet,
commenced a retreat, having suffered
the loss of nearly a thousand men.
This brilliant action in Cumberland
Bay has made the name of Macdonough
the pride and glory of Lake
Champlain; and deservedly so, for his
professional merit appears to have
been no greater than his private worth.
The brave but unfortunate Downie,
who, with a squadron wanting a full
third of being as strong as that of his
antagonist, maintained this gallant
contest, sleeps in a quiet grave at
Plattsburgh, under a simple monument
erected by the affection of a
sister. He is always mentioned
with respectful regret; but Macdonough
is, of course, the hero of
every panegyric. An anecdote which
we heard at Whitehall gives me a
higher opinion of the latter, however,
than all that has been justly said of
his merits as an officer. A few minutes
before the action commenced, he
caused his chaplain to offer the appropriate
prayers in the presence of all
his fleet—the men standing reverently
uncovered, and the commander himself
kneeling upon the deck. An
officer of the Confiance is said to
have observed this becoming, but
somewhat extraordinary, devotion
through his glass, and to have reported
it to Captain Downie, who seemed to
be immediately struck with a foreboding
of the result. The sailors on our
little sloop told us another story of
the action with great expressions of
delight. It seems the hen-coop of
the Saratoga was struck in the beginning
of the action, and a cock becoming
released flew into the rigging, and,
flapping his wings, crowed lustily
through the fire and smoke. The
gunners gave chanticleer a hearty
cheer, and taking the incident as an
omen of victory, stood to their guns
with fresh spirit and enthusiasm.
Smaller things than this have turned
the tide of battles far greater, and
more important to nations and the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'>We spent a day at Plattsburgh
surveying the field and the fort, and
picking up stories of the fight. Relics
of the battle were every where visible;
and grape-shot and cannon-balls were
lying here and there in the ditches.
The evening was fair, and we drove
out to an Indian encampment on the
peninsula, the first thing of the kind
I ever beheld. Entering one of the
wigwams, or huts, I found the squaws
engaged in weaving small baskets of
delicate withes of elm, dyed and stained
with brilliant vegetable-colours.
An infant strapped to a flat board,
and set like a cane or umbrella against
the stakes of the hut, was looking on
with truly Indian stoicism. The
mother said her child never cried;
but whether it runs in the blood, or
is the effect of discipline, is more than
I could learn. On the beach were
canoes of bark, which had been newly
constructed by the men. A squaw,
who desired us to purchase, lifted one
of them with her hand; yet it could
have carried six or seven men with
safety on the lake. We observed that
males and females alike wore crucifixes,
and were evidently Christians,
however degraded and ignorant. They
spoke French, so as to be easily understood,
and some English. These
poor and feeble creatures were the
last of the Iroquois.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day, in post-coaches, we came
into Canada. At St John’s, where we
dined, Freke boisterously drank to his
Majesty. So deep were the loyal feelings
of our friend, however, that he continued
his bumpers to “all the royal
family,” which, though not quite so
great an achievement then as it would
be now, was quite sufficient to consign
him to the attentions of our host,
where we left him without an adieu.
We were much amused by the novelties
of our road, so decidedly Frenchified,
and unlike any thing in the
States. Women, in the costume of
French peasants, were at work in the
fields; and we saw one engaged in
bricklaying at the bottom of a ditch
or cellar. The men in caps, smock-frocks,
and almost always with pipes
in their mouths, drove by in light
<em>charettes</em>, or waggons with rails at the
sides, drawn by stout little ponies of
a plump yet delicate build, and for
cart-horses remarkably fleet. For
the first time in my life I observed
also dogs harnessed in the Esquimaux
manner, and drawing miniature <em>charettes</em>,
laden with bark or faggots.
Every thing reminded us that we
were not in England or America, but
only in Acadie.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were jaunting merrily along,
when vociferous halloos behind us
caused our whip to pull up with a
jerk. A Yorkshire man, in terror of
footpads, began to bellow <em>Drive on!</em>
and our heads were thrust forth in
farcical preparation for a stand-and-deliver
assault, when a waggon was
discovered approaching us, in which
were two men, one without a hat, his
hair streaming like a meteor, and both
bawling <em>Stop, stop!</em> like the post-boy
at the heels of John Gilpin. In a
moment we recognised Freke. With
any thing but a volley of compliments,
he assailed the driver for carrying off
his luggage, which sure enough was
found in the boot, with his splendid
initials inscribed in a constellation of
brass nails. His hat had been blown
off in the pursuit; but after adorning
himself with a turban, he was again
admitted to our company, though not
without some reluctance expressed or
understood. The fumes of his dinner
had not entirely subsided; and I am
sorry to say, that his enthusiasm for
his king and country was about in
inverse proportion to the honour he
did them by his extraordinary appearance.
I wish it had exhausted itself
in song and sentiment; but it was
evident that a strong desire to fight
the whole universe was fast superseding
the exhilaration of reunion
with his friends. Unfortunately a
poor Canadian, in passing with his
<em>charette</em>, struck the wheels of our
coach; and though he alone was the
sufferer, being knocked into a ditch
instantaneously, Freke was upon him
in a second, inflicting such a drubbing
as reminded me forcibly of a similar
incident in Horace’s route to Brundusium.
It was with difficulty that we
succeeded in reducing our hero to a
sense of propriety, and compelling
him to console the astounded provincial
with damages. The sufferer,
who thanked him in French for the
not over generous remuneration,
seemed altogether at a loss to know
for what he had been beaten; and I
am happy to say that the politeness
of the peasant seemed to restore our
military friend to consciousness, and a
fear that he had behaved like a brute.
At the next stage he provided himself
with a Canadian cap, and on
resuming his seat overwhelmed us
with apologies; so that we were
compelled to forgive the aberration,
which was doubtless, as he said, attributable
solely to his loyal concern for
the health of his Majesty, and to an
overflow of spirits at finding himself
once more in the pale of the British
empire.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was late in the afternoon when
we arrived at Laprairie, that little
old Canadian town on the St Lawrence,
where passengers take the
steamer to Montreal. Here was celebrating
some kind of fête which had
brought a procession of nuns into the
street, around whom were congregated
groups of smiling children in
their holiday dresses. I entered a
church, which I found nearly deserted.
A few of the poorer sort of persons
were at prayer, saying their <em>aves</em> and
<em>paters</em> by the rosary—not, as is sometimes
supposed, through voluntary devotion,
but in performance of appointed
penances, which they make
haste to get through. Some funeral
ceremony seemed to be in preparation;
for the church was dark, and a
<em>catafalque</em> near the entrance gave me
a startling sensation of awe. All
that Laprairie could show us was soon
beheld; but our usual fortune had
attended us to the last, and we were
again too late for the steamer. It
would not cross again till the morrow;
yet there was the city of Montreal
distinctly visible before our eyes.
From the quay we could discern, down
the river, the tin roof of the convent
of Grayfriars, glittering brightly in
the descending sun. In fact, the
whole city was glittering, for every
where its spires and roofs shone with
a sheeting of the Cornish material,
which somehow or other, in this
climate, seems to resist oxidisation.
In other respects, the scene was not
remarkable, except that there was
the river—the broad, free, and magnificent
St Lawrence, with its rapids
and its isles. Nuns’ Isle was above
us, and abreast of the city, with its
fortress, was the green St Helen’s,
<em>said to be</em> musical with the notes of
birds, and fragrant with its flowers
and verdure.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were regretting the premature
departure of the steamer, when one of
our party came to announce that some
Canadian boatmen were willing to
take us over in a batteau, if we would
embark without delay. It was nine
miles, and the rapids were high; but
we were informed that our ferrymen
were born to the oar, and might confidently
be trusted with our lives.
We therefore lost no time in stowing
ourselves, and part of our
luggage, into a mere shell of a
boat, manned by half-a-dozen Canadians,
who pulled us into deep
water with an air and a motion peculiarly
their own. Once fairly embarked,
there was something not unpleasant
in finding ourselves upon
the St Lawrence in a legitimate
manner; for steamers were yet a
novelty in those waters, and were
regarded by the watermen with the
same kind of contempt which an old
English mail-coachman feels, in the
bottom of his soul, for stokers and
railways. Finding ourselves, by a
lucky accident, thus agreeably
launched, we naturally desired to
hear a genuine Canadian boat-song,
and were not long in making the
oarsmen understand that an augmentation
of their pay would be cheerfully
afforded, if they would but
favour us with music. Every one
has heard the beautiful words of Tom
Moore, inspired by a similar adventure.
He says of the familiar air to
which they are set, that though critics
may think it trifling, it is for him rich
with that charm which is given by
association to every little memorial
of by-gone scenes and feelings. I
cannot say that the air of our <em>voyageurs</em>
was the same; yet I am quite
inclined to think that the words which
he gives as the burden of the Canadian
boat-song which he heard so
often, were those to which we were
treated. Barbarous, indeed, was
their dialect if they attempted to give
us any thing so definite as the chanson,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">Dans mon chemin j’ai rencontré</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Deux cavaliers, trés-bien montés;</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>but there was a perpetually recurring
<em>refrain</em> which sounded like <em>do—daw—donny-day</em>,
and which I suppose to
be a sort of French <i><span lang="fr">fol-de-rol</span></i>, but
which I can easily conceive to have
been, as our English Anacreon reports
it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">A l’ombre d’un bois je m’en vais jouer,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">A l’ombre d’un bois je m’en vais danser.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Rude as was the verse and the
music, however, I must own that, in
its place on that majestic river, as we
were approaching the rapids whose
white caps were already leaping
about our frail bark, with the meditative
light of sunset throwing a mellow
radiance over all, there was something
that appealed very strongly to the
imagination in that simple Canadian
air. I am not musical, and cannot
recall it; yet even now it will sometimes
ring in my ears, when I go
back in fancy to that bright season of
my life when I too was a <em>voyageur</em>;
and I have often been happy that
accident thus gave me the pleasure of
hearing what I shall never hear again,
and what travellers on the St Lawrence
are every year less and less
likely to hear repeated. Indeed, I am
almost able to adopt every word
which Moore has so poetically appended
to his song. “I remember,”
says he, “when we entered at sunset
upon one of those beautiful lakes into
which the St Lawrence so grandly
and so unexpectedly opens, I have
heard this simple air with a pleasure
which the finest conceptions of the
finest masters have never given me;
and now there is not a note of it which
does not recall to my memory the dip
of our oars in the St Lawrence, the
flight of our boat down the rapids, and
all the new and fanciful impressions to
which my heart was alive during the
whole of this very interesting voyage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But our trip was not all poetry and
song. When we were fairly upon
those bright-looking rapids, we found
our little nutshell quite too heavily
loaded, and were forced to feel our
evident danger with somewhat of
alarm. The billows whirled and tossed
us about, till our Canadians themselves
became frightened, and foolishly
throwing up their oars, began to cross
themselves and to call on the Virgin
and all the saints. The tutelar of the
St Lawrence is said to inhabit hard
by, at St Anne’s,—but such was our
want of confidence in his power to interfere,
that we met this outbreak of
Romish devotion with a protest so
vehement that it would have surprised
the celebrated diet of Spires.
Certain it is that, on resuming their
oars, the fellows did much more for us
than their aspirations had accomplished,
when unaided by efforts. We
soon began to enjoy the dancing of our
batteau, which gradually became less
violent, and was rather inspiring.
Still, as no one but a coward would
sport in safety with dangers which
were once sufficient to appal, let me
confess that I believe I should be
thankful that my journey and my
mortal life were not ended together in
those dangerous waters. I trust it
was not without some inward gratitude
to Him who numbers the very
hairs of our head, that we found ourselves
again in smooth tides, and were
soon landed in safety on the quay at
Montreal.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE CONQUEST OF NAPLES.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The stirring period of the middle
ages, rich in examples of bold emprise
and events of romantic interest,
includes no more striking and
remarkable episode than the invasion
and conquest, by the brother of St
Louis, of the kingdom of the Two
Sicilies. As an episode it has hitherto
been treated—introduced, and not unfrequently
crushed into unmerited
insignificance, in works of general
history. By both historian and poet
fragments have been brought into
strong relief; as an independent
whole, no writer, until the present
time, has ventured and chosen to
attempt its delineation. The virtues
and misfortunes of the last legitimate
descendant of the imperial house of
Stauffen, a house once so numerous
and powerful, have been wept over
by the minstrels to whose fraternity
he belonged, vaunted by indignant
chroniclers, and sung by the greatest
of Italy’s bards. The gallant and successful
insurrection by which the
brightest gem was wrenched from the
French usurper’s fire-new diadem, and
set in Arragon’s crown, has been
repeatedly recorded and enlarged
upon, and not unfrequently mistold.
But the integral treatment of the
conquest of Naples, in a work devoted
to it alone, and worthy of the weight
and interest of the subject—the narrative
of the ousting of the German
dynasty and establishment of a French
one, including the circumstances that
led to the change, and apart from contemporary
and irrelevant history—were
left for the elegant and capable
pen of an author honourably known for
extensive learning and indefatigable
research. The puissant rule of Frederick
the Hohenstauffe—the heroic
virtues and Homeric feats of Charles
of Anjou—the precocious talents, fatal
errors, and untimely end of the luckless
Conradin—have found a fit chronicler
in the accomplished Count of
St Priest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides acknowledged talents and
great industry, this writer has brought
to his arduous task a familiar acquaintance—the
result of long and assiduous
study—with the times and personages
of whom he writes, a sound judgment,
and an honest desire of impartiality.
In his quality of Frenchman
the latter was especially essential,
to guard him against the natural
bias in favour of an illustrious and
valiant countryman, that might lead,
almost unconsciously, to an undue
exaltation of the virtues, and extenuation
of the crimes, of the hero
of his narrative. Nor was this the
only instance in which he was liable
to temptation. The circumstances
and causes of the massacre known
as the Sicilian Vespers, were handed
down, in the first instance, by
Italian writers, in the adoption of
whose views and assertions subsequent
historians have perhaps displayed
too great servility. If we consider
the vindictive and treacherous
instincts of the Sicilians, their fierce
impatience of foreign domination, and
the slight account made of human life
by the natives of southern Europe
generally, we cannot too hastily
reject the assertions and arguments by
which M. de St Priest props his
opinion, that the vengeance was greater
than the offence, the oppressed more
cruel than the oppressor. History
affixes to an entire nation the stigma
of goading a conquered people to madness,
by arrogance, injustice, and excess.
M. de St Priest takes up the
defence, and, without claiming for
his client an honourable acquittal,
strives, by the production of extenuating
circumstances, to induce the
world to reconsider its severe and
sweeping verdict. He asks whether
the evidence has been sufficiently
sifted, whether the facts have been
properly understood and appreciated,
or even known. “I think,” he says,
“they have not. The Sicilians themselves
acknowledge this. One of their
most distinguished writers has suspected
falsehood, and sought the
truth; but he has done so only in a
very exclusive, and consequently a
very incomplete point of view. He
has aggravated the reproach that rests
upon the memory of the French of the
thirteenth century. In my turn, I
have resumed the debate with a national
feeling as strong, but less partial
I hope, than that of most of the Italian
and German annalists, in whose footsteps
our own historians have trodden
with undue complaisance. It is time
to stand aloof from these, and to reply
to them.” It would be inverting the
order of our subject, here to dilate
upon M. de St Priest’s views concerning
the massacre, to which we may
hereafter recur. He scarcely makes
out so good a case for the French victims
to Sicilian vengeance as he does
for the most prominent personage of
his book, Charles of Anjou, whose
character he handles with masterly
skill. He admits his crimes—sets off
with their acknowledgment; and yet
so successfully does he palliate them
by the received ideas of the time, by
the necessities and perplexities of a
most difficult position, that the reader
forgets the faults in the virtues of the
hero, and receives an impression decidedly
favourable to the first French
sovereign of Naples. “Had I proposed,”—we
quote from the preface—“to
write a biography, and not a history,
to paint a portrait instead of a
picture, I might have recoiled before
my hero. The blood of Conradin
still cries out against his pitiless
conqueror; but the crime of the chief
must not be imputed to the army.
Aged warriors were seen to weep and
pray around the scaffold of a child.
The end I propose is not that of a
retrospective vindication—an ungrateful,
and often a puerile task. Charles
of Anjou was guilty. That fact admitted,
he still remains the greatest
captain, the sole organising genius,
and one of the most illustrious princes
of a period fertile in great kings. Like
his brother Louis IX., from whom, in
other respects, he was only too different,
he valiantly served France. He
carried the French name into the most
distant countries. By his political
combinations, by the alliances he
secured for his family as much as by
his victories, Charles I., King of
Sicily, seated his lineage upon the
thrones of Greece, Hungary, and Poland.
Yet more—he saved the western
world from another Mahomedan
invasion, less perceived, but not less
imminent, than the invasions of the
eighth and seventeenth centuries. The
bust of Charles of Anjou merits a place
between the statues of Charles Martel
and John Sobieski.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This high eulogium, at the very
commencement of the book, strikes
us as scarcely according with the promise
of impartiality recorded upon the
following page. The meed of praise
exceeds that we should be disposed to
allot to the conqueror of Naples. Still,
upon investigation, it is difficult to
controvert his historian’s assertions,
although some of them admit of modification.
Here M. de St Priest rather
veils and overlooks his hero’s faults
than denies them to have existed. He
says nothing in this place of the misgovernment
that lost Sicily, within a
few years of its reduction. Yet to such
misrule, more even than to the excesses
of a licentious soldiery—partly
consequent on it—was attributable the
temporary separation of that fair
island from the Neapolitan dominions.
Subsequently he admits the imprudent
contempt shown by Charles to this
portion of his new kingdom, his injudicious
choice of the agents and representatives
of his authority, the exclusion
of the natives from public offices
and employments—filled almost wholly
by Frenchmen—with many other arbitrary,
oppressive, and unjust measures,
sometimes more vexatious in
form than efficient for the end proposed;
as, for instance, the decree
disarming the Sicilians, which must
have been wretchedly enforced, since
the Palermitans, when the signal for
slaughter was given, were at no loss
for weapons to exterminate their
tyrants. Whilst admitting the skill
shown by Charles in his foreign policy,
and in the formation of great and
advantageous alliances, we must refuse
him, upon his advocate’s own showing,
the merit of able internal administration.
His military virtues are less
questionable, although the greatest of
his victories, which placed his rival in
his power and secured his seat on the
Neapolitan throne, was due less to any
generalship of his own than to the
bold stratagem of a gray-headed
crusader.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apart from its historical importance,
M. de St Priest’s work is valuable
as exposing and illustrating the
peculiar ideas, strange customs, and
barbarous prejudices of a remote and
highly interesting period, less known
than it deserves, and whose annals
and archives few have explored more
industriously than himself. In this
point of view are we disposed, whilst
glancing at some of the principal
events it records, especially to consider
it; and under this aspect it will
probably be most prized and esteemed
by the majority. A greater familiarity
than the general mass of readers
possess with the complicated history
of the second period of the middle
ages is requisite for the due appreciation
of the book, and especially of its
first volume. This is purely introductory
to the conquest. The name of
the conqueror is mentioned for the first
time upon its last page. The matter
it contains is not the less essential. It
sketches the establishment of the Norman
dynasty in Sicily; the elevation
of that country into a monarchy by
Duke Roger II.; the fall of the family
of Tancred, and the reign of Frederick
II., (Emperor of Germany, and
grandson of Barbarossa,) who inherited
the crown of the Two Sicilies in
right of his mother, the posthumous
daughter of Roger, and the last of the
Norman line. This brings us into the
thick of the long-standing feud between
the Pope and the Empire, which,
after having had the whole of Europe
for its battle-field, at last concentrated
itself in a single country. “Towards
the middle of the thirteenth century
it was transported to the southern
extremity of Italy, to the rich and
beautiful lands now composing the
kingdom of Naples. The quarrel of
the investitures terminated by the
crusade of Sicily; a debate about
ecclesiastical jurisdiction ended in a
dispute concerning territorial possession.
But although reduced to less
vast proportions and more simple
terms, the antagonism of the pontificate
and the throne lost nothing of
its depth, activity, and strength. Far
from becoming weakened, it assumed
the more implacable and rancorous
character of a personal encounter. The
war became a duel. It was natural
that this should happen. So soon as
a regular power was founded in the
south of Italy, Rome could not permit
the same power to establish itself in
the north of the peninsula. The interest
of the temporal existence of the
popedom, the geographical position of
the States of the Church, rendered this
policy stringent. The Popes could
never allow Lombardy and the Two
Sicilies to be united under one sceptre.
A King of Naples, as King of the
Lombards, pressed them on all sides;
but as Emperor he crushed them. This
formidable hypothesis realised itself.
A German dynasty menaced the Holy
See, and was broken. A French dynasty
was called to replace it, and
obtained victory, power, and duration.”
When this occurred—when the Pope,
beholding from the towers of Civita
Vecchia his earthly sway menaced
with annihilation, and the Saracen
hordes of Sicily’s powerful King ravaging
the Campagna, fulminated anathemas
upon the impious invaders,
and summoned to his aid a prince of
France—Manfredi, Prince of Tarento,
or Mainfroy, as M. de St Priest prefers
to call him, the natural son of
Frederick II., was the virtual sovereign
of the Two Sicilies. Frederick,
who died in his arms, left him regent
of the kingdom during the absence in
Germany of his legitimate son Conrad—named
his heir in preference to
his grandson Frederick, the orphan
child of his eldest son Henry, who had
died a rebel, conquered and captive.
This was not all. “The imperial
will declared the Prince of Tarento
bailiff or viceroy of the Two Sicilies,
with unlimited powers and regal
rights, whenever Conrad should be
resident in Germany or elsewhere.
Things were just then in the state thus
provided for. Mainfroy became <i><span lang="la">ipso
facto</span></i> regent of the kingdom; and
the lucky bastard saw himself not
only eventually called to the powerful
inheritance of the house of Suabia,
but preferred to the natural and direct
heir of so many crowns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The death of Frederick the Hohenstauffe,
who for long after his decease
was popularly known—as in our day
a greater than he still is—as <em>the</em>
Emperor, revived the hopes and
courage of Pope Innocent IV., who
resolved to strike a decisive blow at
the power of the house of Suabia.
Mainfroy was then its representative
in Italy. He was only nineteen—a
feeble enemy, so thought Innocent,
whom a word from the pontifical
throne would suffice to level with the
dust. But where the sanguine Pope
expected to find a child, he met
a man, in talent, energy, and prudence.
These qualities Mainfroy displayed
in an eminent degree in the struggle
that ensued; and when Conrad landed
in his kingdom, which had been
represented to him as turbulent and
agitated, he was astonished at the
tranquillity it enjoyed. He embraced
his brother, and insisted on his walking
by his side, under the same dais,
from the sea to the city. This good
understanding did not last long. Conrad
was jealous of the man who had
so ably supplied his place, and jealousy
at last became hatred. He deprived
Mainfroy of the possessions secured
to him by his father’s will, banished
his maternal relatives with ignominy,
and did all he could, but in vain, to
drive him to revolt. Under these
circumstances, it is not surprising that
when Conrad died, at the age<a id='t439'></a> of twenty-six,
leaving Berthold, Margrave of
Hohemburg, regent of the kingdom
during the minority of his son Conrad
V., or Conradin—who had been born
since his departure from Germany,
and whom he had never seen—there
were not wanting persons to accuse
Mainfroy as an accessary to his death.
Mainfroy had already been charged—falsely,
there can be little doubt—of
having smothered, under mattresses,
his father and benefactor, the Emperor
Frederick. There was more probability,
if not more truth, in the accusation
of fratricide; for, if Conrad had
lived, doubtless Mainfroy would,
sooner or later, have been sacrificed
to his jealousy or safety. “The majority
of chroniclers assign to Mainfroy,
as an accomplice, a physician of
Salerno; and add, with the credulity
of the times, that he killed the King of
the Romans by introducing diamond
dust, an infallible poison, into his
entrails.  Others, bolder or better
informed, give the name of the poisoner,
and call him John of Procida.”
Whether this death resulted from poison
or disease, it was hailed as a happy
event by the Italians, and with a
great burst of laughter by the Pope,
who at once renounced his project of
calling a foreign prince to the throne
of Sicily, and resumed, with fresh
ardour, his plans of conquest and
annexation. Advancing to the Neapolitan
frontier, he was there met by
the Prince of Tarento and the Margrave
of Hohemburg, who came to
place themselves at his disposal, and
to supplicate him on behalf of the infant
Conradin. The Pope, who saw
a proof of weakness in this humility,
insisted that the Two Sicilies should
be delivered up to the Church; saying
that he would then investigate the
rights of Conradin, and admit them if
valid. The Margrave, alarmed at the
aspect of things, made over the
regency to Mainfroy, who accepted it
with affected repugnance. A powerful
party called this prince to the
throne: it was the aristocratic and
national party, averse alike to papal
domination and to the government of
a child. They entered into an agreement
with Mainfroy, by which they
swore to obey him as regent, so long
as the little King should live; stipulating
that if he died a minor, or without
direct heirs, the Prince of Tarento
should succeed him as sovereign. The
Margrave of Hohemburg, faithless to
the trust reposed in him by Conrad,
agreed to these conditions, and promised
to deliver up to Mainfroy the
late King’s treasures. Instead of so
doing, the double traitor made his
escape with them, leaving the new
regent in such poverty that, in order
to pay his German mercenaries, he was
compelled to sell the hereditary jewels
and gold and silver vases of his
mother’s family.</p>

<p class='c009'>If Mainfroy had made good fight in
defence of Conrad’s rights, we may be
sure he did not less strenuously strive
when his own claim was to be vindicated.
Unfortunate at first, and
about to succumb to papal power and
intrigues, he, as a last resource, threw
himself into the arms of the Saracens
of Lucera. These unbelievers had
been greatly encouraged by his father,
who was passionately addicted to
things oriental. “From his infancy,”
M. de St Priest says of Frederick, “he
lived surrounded with astrologers,
eunuchs, and odaliques. His palace
was a seraglio, himself a sultan. This
was quite natural. In Sicily all visible
objects were Asiatic. The external
form of the houses, their internal
architecture, the streets, the baths,
the gardens, even the churches, bore
the stamp of Islamism. The praises
of God are still to be seen engraved
in Arabic on marble columns; and in
the same language were they traced,
in gold and diamonds and pearls, upon
the mantle and dalmatica of Sicily’s
Queens and Kings. Palermo was
then called the trilingual city. Latin
and Arabic were equally spoken there;
and the Italian, the <i><span lang="it">favella volgare</span></i>,
originated at the court of Frederick-Roger,
under the Moorish arcades of
his palaces at Palermo and Catania.
The language of Petrarch was murmured,
for the first time, beside the
fountains of the Ziza. The outward
forms of Islamism were then, in
southern Europe, the ensign hoisted by
that small number of liberal thinkers,
the avowed enemies of ecclesiastical
and monkish domination, who willingly
assumed the name of Epicureans.”
Further on we have the following,
explanatory of the peaceable
settlement of the infidel in Sicily, and
curiously illustrating the contradictions
and bigotry of the time. “With
an audacity previously unheard-of,
Frederick II., after fighting and conquering
the Saracens who overran
and disturbed Sicily, transported entire
colonies of them to Lucera, in the
Capitanata, in the immediate vicinity
of the patrimony of St Peter, thus
planting, in the heart of his kingdom,
the Mahomedan standard he was
about to combat in Syria. Decrepid
though he was, Pope Honorius felt the
danger and insult of such proximity.
What were the arms of the holy see
against an opponent that none of its
anathemas could touch? The Pontiff
became indignant, vented threats; but
was soon appeased. When the wily
Frederick saw him angry, he promised
a crusade; whereupon the Pope calmed
himself, and treated the Emperor as
a son.” Subsequent Popes were less
easy to pacify, and ban and excommunication
were heaped upon the
Emperor’s head. Gregory IX., in
his bulls, called him “<em>a marine
monster, whose jaws are full of blasphemies</em>;”
to which complimentary
phrase Frederick replied by the epithets
of “<em>great dragon, antichrist</em>,”
and “<em>new Balaam</em>.” A third extract
will complete the sketch of the Saracens,
and their position in Sicily.
“Surrounded by odaliques and dancing
women; giving eunuchs for
guards to his wife, the beautiful Isabella
Plantagenet, a daughter of the
English King; often clothed in oriental
robes; in war-time mounted on
an elephant; in his palace surrounded
by tame lions; always accompanied
by a troop of Mussulmans, to whom he
showed great indulgence, permitting
them the violation of churches and
women, debauch and sacrilege,—Frederick
II., in the opinion of his
subjects, was no longer a Christian
prince. During the last ten years of
his reign this state of things reached
its height. The number of barbarian
troops daily increased. Seventeen
new companies, summoned from
Africa, were dispersed, like an invading
army, over the Basilicata and
Calabria. Finally, the Emperor went
so far as to instal them in the places
of masters of ports, and in other offices
that gave these Mussulmans jurisdiction
over Christian populations.” And
when a Saracen captain, named Phocax,
in garrison at Trani, ill-treated a
citizen of noble birth, Messer Simone
Rocca, and grossly outraged his wife,
the aggrieved man could obtain no
satisfaction. “The Emperor only
laughed. ‘<i><span lang="it">Messer Simone</span></i>,’ he said,
to the complainant, ‘<i><span lang="it">dov’è forza non
è vergogna</span></i>. Go, Phocax will not do
it again; had he been a native of the
country, I would have had his head
cut off.’” On the death of this indulgent
patron, the Saracen colony in
the kingdom of Naples saw its existence
menaced. The infidels were lost
if Rome became mistress of the country.
The triumph of the Pope would
be the tocsin of their extermination.
They resolved to defend themselves
to the last. They held Lucera, Accerenza,
and Girafalco, three impregnable
fortresses; they also commanded
at other points, less strong
but still important. They felt themselves
numerous, courageous, and determined.
Mainfroy could not doubt
that they would gladly rally round
the banner of their benefactor’s son;
and in this hope he set out for Lucera,
where John the Moor then
commanded. This man, a slave whom
the Emperor’s caprice had raised to
the highest dignities, promised Mainfroy
the best of receptions. But when
the Prince of Tarento reached Lucera,
the traitor had gone over to the Pope,
taking with him a thousand Saracens
and three hundred Germans, and leaving
the town in the keeping of a man
of his tribe, Makrizi by name. On
learning this treachery, Mainfroy still
did not renounce his project of confiding
himself to the Arabs—so cherished
by his father, so favoured by
himself. Only, instead of approaching
the fortress with his little army,
as regent of the kingdom, he preferred
to go as a knight-errant, attended
only by three esquires, like a paladin
of the Round Table. This portion of
Mainfroy’s life, as well as many other
passages in M. de St Priest’s book, reads
like an extract from some old romance
of chivalry. After wandering about,
in the gloom and rain of a November
night, and losing his way repeatedly,
Adenulfo, one of Mainfroy’s
three men-at-arms, and formerly
forester to Frederick II., perceived a
white object in the darkness, and recognised
a hunting-lodge built by the
Emperor. He conducted the prince
thither, and they lighted a large fire,—a
most imprudent act, for the flame
was easily perceptible at Foggia, where
Otho of Hohemburg was then in
garrison with a portion of the papal
army. But Mainfroy was young and
a poet. At sight of the splendid trees
blazing on the hearth, he forgot the
present, and thought only of the past;
perhaps he recalled the time, not yet
very distant, when as a child, on
winter nights like that one, and perchance
in that very place, he had seen
his father, on his return from an imperial
hunt, seat himself at that same
hearth, and talk familiarly with his
attendants of his wars and his amours,
singing the praises of the lovely Catalanas,<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
and venting curses on the
Pope. The illusion was of short duration.
At early dawn Mainfroy and
his little escort took horse, and after
an hour’s march they beheld, through
the misty morning air, the tall hill of
Lucera, and on its summit the Saracen
citadel and its massive walls,
crowned with two-and-twenty towers.
But the guardians of the gate refused
to open without orders from Makrizi,
who moreover, it would appear, had
the key in his keeping. Sure that he
would deny admittance, they urged
the prince to enter as he best might,
for that, once within the walls, all
would go well. Beneath the gate
was a sort of trench, or gutter, to
carry off the rain, and through this it
was not difficult for a young man of
twenty, slender and active like Mainfroy,
to squeeze himself. He attempted
to do so, but the Saracens could not
support the sight of their Emperor’s
son grovelling on the ground like a
reptile. “Let us not,” they exclaimed,
“allow<a id='t441'></a> our lord to enter our walls
in this vile posture. Let his entrance
be worthy of a prince! Let us break
the gates!” In an instant these were
overthrown; Mainfroy passed over
their ruins, and was carried upon the
shoulders of the Saracens to the public
market-place, surrounded by a joyous
multitude. He met Makrizi, who,
furious at the news of his entrance,
was summoning the garrison to arms.
“Makrizi! Makrizi!” cried the Saracens
and the people, “get off your
horse, and kiss the prince’s feet!”
The Arab obeyed, and prostrated
himself. Mainfroy had valiantly
played his last stake, and fortune
favoured his audacity. In Lucera he
found the treasures of Frederick II.,
of King Conrad, of the Margrave
Berthold, and of John the Moor.
Then, as ever, money was the sinew
of war. Its possession changed the
aspect of affairs. In less than a
month, the proscribed and fugitive
Mainfroy had dispersed the Pope’s
army, taken and executed John the
Moor, and marched upon Naples to
seize a crown. And now, for many
years, his career of success was unchequered
by a reverse. His arms
were uniformly triumphant in the
field; he was the most magnificent
prince, and passed as the richest
sovereign, in Europe. At last the
marriage of his daughter Constance
with the Infante Don Pedro, son<a id='t442'></a>
of King James of Arragon, crowned
his prosperity. Concluded in defiance
of the court of Rome, this marriage
allied the bastard Prince of Tarento
with the French royal family; for
Isabella of Arragon, sister of his son-in-law
Don Pedro, became the wife of
Philip, son of Louis IX., and heir apparent
to the crown of France. This
last piece of good fortune nearly turned
Mainfroy’s head. Instead of defending
himself against the Holy See, he
assumed the offensive, and invaded
its territories. Moreover, he now
openly professed, and established as
a principle, that the right to dispose
of the imperial diadem was not vested
in the Popes, but in the senate and
people of Rome. “It is time,” he
added, “to put an end to this usurpation.”
Such maxims, thus publicly
proclaimed, rendered the Pope irreconcilable.
The papal dream of annexing
the Two Sicilies to the pontificate
had long melted into air before
the sun of Mainfroy’s arrogant prosperity;
and Urban IV., convinced that
the Church had need of a valiant and
devoted defender, turned his eyes
northwards, whilst his lips pronounced
the name of Charles of Anjou.</p>

<p class='c009'>Charles, the <em>good</em> Count of Anjou,
as some of the chroniclers call him,
was married to Beatrix of Savoy,
Countess of Provence, whose hand he
obtained in preference to two formidable
rivals,—Conrad, son of the
Hohenstauffe, and Pedro of Arragon.
The latter we have just referred to as
having subsequently married a daughter
of Mainfroy. Through life Peter
and Charles were destined to be
rivals; and if the latter had the advantage
at the outset, his competitor
afterwards in some degree balanced
the account by robbing him of the
island of Sicily. In 1248, soon after
his marriage, Charles embarked at
Aiguesmortes with his brother Louis
and their wives, on a crusade,—was
sick to death at the island of Cyprus,
but recovered, and performed prodigies
of valour in fight with the Saracen.
It seemed as if the scent of
battle sufficed to restore him his full
vigour; and he displayed a furious
impetuosity and reckless daring that
almost surpass belief. On arriving
off Damietta, and at sight of the
Saracen army waiting on the shore,
he and St Louis sprang from their
galley, and waded to land, with the water
to their waists. Surrounded by the
enemy, Charles raised a wall of corpses
around him, until his knights came up
to the rescue. Heading them, he
charged the infidel host, ordering to
strike at the horses’ breasts. The
noble Arab chargers fell by hundreds;
the Saracens fled; Louis and Charles
pursued; Damietta was the prize of
the Christians. “The adventurous
prince feared the elements as little as
he did man. One day the Saracens
threw Greek fire upon the crusaders’
tents. Struck with surprise at sight
of this mysterious enemy, the Christians
were so terrified that they dared not
attempt to extinguish the flames. ‘I
will go,’ cried the Count of Anjou.
They tried to retain him by force, but
he broke from them like a madman,
and succeeded in his design. At
another time, St Louis, from the top
of a hill, saw him engaged single-handed
with a whole troop of Saracens,
who hurled at him darts with
flaming flags, which stuck into and
burnt his horse’s crupper. Thus did
Charles display the first symptoms of
a will incapable of receding even before
impossibilities,—a dangerous application
of a great virtue; but then, these
feats of the Count of Anjou delighted
every body. Other exploits followed.
Like a Christian Horatius, Charles
one day stopped the whole Mussulman
army upon a wooden bridge.” This
great bravery was accompanied by
pride, egotism, and hardness of heart,
and these qualities caused bickerings
between him and St Louis. Nevertheless,
the brothers were fondly
attached to each other; and when
Charles returned to Provence he displayed
a depth of emotion on parting
from his king that surprised the army,
which did not give him credit for so
much fraternal affection. There was
great contrast of character between
him and his royal brother. “They
had in common,” says M. de St Priest,
“military courage, chastity, probity,
and respect to their plighted word....
St Louis was a Frenchman,
Charles of Anjou a Spaniard. St
Louis had that communicative disposition,
that taste for social enjoyment,
that necessity of expansion and
gentle gaiety, generally attributed to
our nation. He was evidently the
man born beside the waters of Loire
or Seine. Charles, on the other
hand, seemed to have received life
upon the rugged rocks of Toledo, or
in the naked and melancholy plains of
Valladolid. He was proud and
gloomy; no smile ever curved his
lips. Uncommunicative, he confided
his designs to no one. Although
hasty, violent, and passionate, he
strove to conceal his emotions. He
slept little, spoke less; never forgot
a service or an injury. His indulgence
for his partisans and servants
was unbounded: if he was passionately
fond of gold, it was especially
that he might shower it upon them.
Charles and Louis were a contrast
even in form and colour of face.
Louis was fair and ruddy; Charles
had black hair, an olive skin, nervous
limbs, and a prominent nose. Goodness
was the characteristic of the king,
severity of the count. Both of imposing
aspect,—one as a father, the
other as a master—Louis inspired
respect and love, Charles respect and
terror. By the admission of all his
contemporaries, nothing could be more
majestic than the look, gait, and
stature of the Count of Anjou. In an
assemblage of princes he eclipsed
them all. A poet who knew him well,
and who calls him the most <em>seignorial</em>
of men, shows him to us at the court
of France in the midst of his brothers,
and characterises him by this energetic
line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Tous furent filz de roy, mais Charles le fut mieux.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Such was the man who, on the 15th
May 1265, embarked at Marseilles for
Rome, with a thousand chosen knights
upon thirty galleys, leaving the main
body of his army at Lyons to cross
the Alps with the Countess Beatrix,
under the nominal command of the
young Robert de Bethune Dampierre,
heir to the county of Flanders, and
the real guidance of Gilles de Traisignies,
constable of France. At the
moment of his departure, timid counsellors
magnified the peril of the enterprise,
and the superiority of the hostile
fleet that watched to intercept him;
but nothing could shake the determination
of the Count of Anjou. “Good
conduct,” he said, as he put foot on
his galley’s deck, “overcomes ill
fortune. I promised the Pope to be
at Rome before Pentecost, and I will
keep my word.” If fortune had not
favoured him, however, it is doubtful
if he would have succeeded in running
the gauntlet through the sixty Sicilian
galleys, manned with the practised
mariners of Pisa, Naples, and Amalfi,
that waited to pounce, like hawk on
sparrow, upon his feeble armament.
Independently of this formidable squadron,
the entrance of the port of
Ostia was encumbered, by Mainfroy’s
order, with beams and huge stones,
against which the French ships were
expected inevitably to shatter themselves.
Altogether, the marine preparations
were so formidable, they
were proclaimed with such ostentation,
and Mainfroy appeared so convinced
of their efficacy, that at Rome
the partisans of Charles and the Pope
lost courage. The decisive moment
arrived, and no fleet appeared; when
suddenly a rumour spread that Charles
was shipwrecked and drowned. The
Ghibellines, or imperialists, hailed the
report with delight, the Guelfs with
terror. Friends and enemies alike
believed the fatal intelligence, when
at break of day, on the eve of Pentecost,
a boat, containing ten men,
entered the Tiber. Amongst these
ten men was Charles of Anjou. He
owed his safety to his peril; deliverance
had grown out of impending
destruction. A violent storm had had
a double result: Mainfroy’s fleet,
which for some days past had blockaded
the Tiber, was compelled to put
to sea, and the thirty Provençal galleys
were dispersed in view of Pisa. Charles
was wrecked on the coast of Tuscany;
to escape capture by one of Mainfroy’s
lieutenants, he threw himself into a
skiff, and the wind guided him into
the Tiber, which he entered unperceived
by the Sicilian admiral. Such
was the fortunate chance that served
him. Men believed him at the bottom
of the sea, and at that moment
he landed in Italy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mainfroy prepared for defence, affecting
boundless confidence in the
result of the approaching strife, but in
reality uneasy at the approach of his
formidable foe. His hatred found vent
in sarcasm and abusive words. “Although
the name of the terrible Charles
of Anjou did not encourage childish
diminutives, Mainfroy and his flatterers
never spoke of him otherwise
than as Carlotto” (Charley.) This
was not very dignified or in good
taste. But Charles was at no loss for
a retort. When his wife had joined
him, at the head of thirty thousand
men, and the royal pair had been
crowned in the Church of the Lateran,
in sight and amidst the acclamations
of an immense multitude, King and
Queen of Sicily, he marched upon
Naples. At the frontier, Mainfroy,
after a vain attempt to intimidate the
Pope, endeavoured to delay his progress
by negotiation. “Tell the Sultan
of Lucera,” replied Charles to the
Swabian envoys, “that between us
there can be neither peace nor truce;
that soon he shall transport me to paradise
or I will send him to hell.” And
having thus branded his opponent as
an infidel, and his opponent’s cause as
unjust, he resolutely entered the Neapolitan
states. The first barrier to his
progress, the fortified bridge of Ceprano,
was opened to him by Riccardo
d’Aquino, Count of Caserte, out of
revenge for the alleged seduction or
violation of his wife by Mainfroy. The
count was about to defend the post,
when news of his dishonour reached
him. He vowed a terrible revenge;
but, scrupulous even in his anger, he
sent to consult the casuists of the
French camp, whether a vassal had
the right to punish the liege lord who
had outraged him in his honour. The
casuists made an affirmative reply, and
Caserte gave free passage to Charles
of Anjou. History is more positive
of the count’s treason than of
the outrage said to have induced it.
The occupation of the bridge was but
a small step towards the conquest of
the Two Sicilies. Charles’s path was
beset with obstacles, augmented by
the difficulty of transporting his warlike
engines, and by fierce dissensions
in his army. These alone were sufficient
to ruin the enterprise; but the
valour and military science of the
French prince supplied all deficiencies.
His operations were sometimes, however,
a little impeded from pious
scruples; as, for instance, when he
put off the assault of a town for two
days, in order not to fight on Ash
Wednesday. Nevertheless his progress
was rapid and triumphant, and
soon the silver fleur-de-lis of France,
and the crimson ones of the Guelfs,
floated above the walls or over the
ruins of Mainfroy’s strongest forts.
All the Saracens who fell into Charles’s
hands were immediately put to the
sword. At last, in the valley of Santa
Maria de Grandella, and at four miles
from the town of Benevento, the French
army—to which were now united the
levies of many disaffected Neapolitan
nobles—came in sight of Mainfroy’s
host, drawn up in order of battle.
The strength of the two armies is variously
stated, but it appears certain
that the numerical advantage was considerably
on the side of Charles. Before
engaging, each leader made a
speech to his troops. That of Charles
reminds us of Cromwell’s well-known
exhortation to his men, to
trust in God and keep their powder
dry. “Have confidence in
God,” said the valiant and pious
Frenchman, “but neglect not human
means; and be attentive, when battle
begins, to what I now tell you: strike
at the horses rather than at the men,
not with edge, but with point; so that,
falling with his horse and being unable
to rise quickly, on account of the
weight of his armour, the cavalier may
immediately have his throat cut by
the <em>ribauds</em>. Let each of you be always
accompanied by one of those
varlets, and even by two. Forget not
that, and march!” The manœuvre
prescribed by Charles of Anjou, and
which he had already essayed in Palestine,
was forbidden by chivalrous
etiquette, which stigmatised as disloyal
the act of striking at the horses’
heads. But Charles was not at a
tournament. His aim was victory,
and his injunction was well received
by his knights, whom his words excited,
says a chronicler, <em>as the huntsman
excites the dogs</em>. There was
neither blame nor murmur. Nevertheless
his chevaliers were the flower
of nobility; but they did not hold
themselves engaged in a regular war;
they looked upon the expedition as a
crusade against infidels. The bishop
of Auxerre gave a final benediction;
the trumpets sounded, and the signal
of battle echoed through both camps.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither army had left its ground
when the clamour of many thousand
voices was heard; and, like a whirlwind,
the Saracen archers from Lucera
poured upon the field. Crossing
the little river Calora, they
fell upon the French infantry with a
discharge of arrows. The French,
with loud cries of “Down with the
Saracens! Down with the swine!”
rushed furiously to meet them. The
medley was terrible, and at first victory
favoured the turban. Charles’s
troops broke and fled, when Ruggiero
San Severino rallied them, waving, by
way of banner, a bloody shirt, stripped
from a soldier’s corpse. Philip de Montfort
brought up the reserve, and threw
himself upon the Saracens, whom he
cut to pieces with cries of “Montfort,
chevaliers!” “Swabia, chevaliers!”
replied Gualvano Lancia, who, without
waiting orders from Mainfroy,
hurried forward a thousand men of
the best German troops. He fell upon
the French, who were weary with
striking, and made a great slaughter
of them. Charles of Anjou, who in his
part of the field performed, as usual,
prodigies of valour, now left the wing
he commanded and attacked Gualvano
Lancia. The Germans and Saracens
were cut to pieces and dispersed; but
the Italian battalions, commanded by
nobles of the country, had not yet
shared the combat. Mainfroy had kept
them as a reserve, and now called
upon them to follow him. Instead of
so doing, they turned their backs and
fled. At the same moment a silver
eagle, surmounting Mainfroy’s
helm, fell and broke in pieces. At
this evil omen, the son of the Hohenstauffe
felt himself lost. He turned
towards the faithful few who still stood
by him, and said in the words of the
Catholic Church: <i><span lang="la">Hoc est signum Dei</span></i>.
Then, followed by Tibaldo Annibaldi,
he plunged into the thickest of the
hostile squadrons, and was seen no
more alive. For three days nothing
was heard of him, and Charles of Anjou
thought he had escaped, when a
soldier led his war-horse past the
window of Gualvano Lancia and two
other Ghibelline prisoners. On recognising
the steed, the captives burst
into tears, and implored the soldier, a
Picard, to tell them the fate of its
rider, whether prisoner, slain, or fugitive.
“The Picard, having learned
who the prisoners were, replied thus:
‘I will tell you the truth; during
the fight, the man who mounted this
horse came up, uttering terrible cries.
He rushed into the mêlée, followed by
another cavalier much less than himself,
and fell upon us with such courage
that, had he been supported by others
as brave, he would have beaten us or
given us much to do. I showed front
to this knight and wounded his charger
in the head with a lance-thrust; the
horse, feeling itself wounded, threw
its rider; then the <em>ribauds</em> despoiled
him of his arms and made an end of
him. As his scarf was very beautiful,
I took it, as well as his horse; and here
they both are.’ Such was the noble
end of Manfred, or Machtfried, of
Stauffen, whom the French were wont
to call Mainfroy of Sicily.” With
great difficulty, the royal corpse was
found, amidst heaps of slain, and the
French chevaliers entreated Charles
to allow it honourable burial. “Willingly,”
replied Charles, “were he not
excommunicated.” The new King of
Sicily could not reasonably be expected
to grant ecclesiastical interment
to the man, whom he had fought
and supplanted on the sole ground of
his being out of the pale of the church.
So a trench was dug at the foot of the
bridge over the Calora, the body was
laid in it, the army filed by, and each
soldier, as he passed, threw a stone
upon the unconsecrated grave. As
great warriors have had worse monuments.
But papal hatred followed
Mainfroy even beyond the tomb.
Under pretence that the remains of
the excommunicated hero infected the
pontifical soil, Clement IV.’s nuncio
had them unearthed and dragged at
night, without torches, to the banks
of the Garigliano. There they were
abandoned to the pelting storm and
prowling beast of prey. “Whilst a
savage fanaticism thus insulted the
ashes of Sicily’s King, poetry prepared
him a glorious revenge. Eight months
before the battle of Benevento, a child
was born at Florence, in May 1265,
whose name was Dante Alighieri.
Dante protected the memory of Mainfroy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For eight days the unfortunate town
of Benevento was abandoned to the
horrors of the sack. At the end of
that time Charles called his greedy
soldiers from pillage and excess, rallied
them round his standard and marched
to Naples. The magnificence of his
entrance dazzled and delighted the
people, surpassing even the vaunted
splendour of the proud Hohenstauffen.
In every respect Charles’s victory
was complete. The Anjevine banner
floated throughout the kingdom of
Naples; and after very slight resistance
on the part of Gualvano Lancia
and of Conrad of Antioch, an illegitimate
grandson of the Emperor
Frederick, Sicily and Calabria were
also reduced and tranquillised. But
the triumphant king was still surrounded
with difficulties. His pecuniary
obligations were numerous
and heavy, and his new kingdom
offered no resources for their acquittal.
The population was greatly reduced,
agriculture had disappeared,
commerce was at the very lowest ebb,
the nobility were ruined, and revenue
there was none. On the other hand,
Charles’s troops were clamorous for
arrears; and the Pope, who had
pledged the treasures of the Roman
churches to Tuscan bankers for funds
to carry on the war, was urgent in his
demands of repayment, and went so
far as to threaten his debtor with excommunication.
Charles the First
was in great perplexity. The clergy,
who alone had some means, he was
forbidden to tax, by the terms of his
treaty with the Pope. In this dilemma,
the King was compelled to resort to
imposts and extortions, which rendered
him odious to his subjects. In this
respect he was no worse, perhaps, than
his immediate predecessors, who seldom
scrupled to raise a forced contribution,
even by the armed hand; but
his manner of procuring his supplies
was particularly obnoxious to the
Neapolitans. He reduced it to a regular
system, based upon the French
fiscal forms.  The people preferred
the occasional swoop of a party of
Saracens to the tax-gatherer’s systematic
spoliation. The irritation became
general. Murmurs and complaints
were heard on all sides, mingled
with regrets for Mainfroy. The
Pope, unwilling to share Charles’s
unpopularity, dissatisfied at the nonpayment
of his advances, and but
slightly appeased by the present of a
golden throne and candelabra sent
him from the sack of Benevento,
wrote harsh letters to his ally, and
sent him long lectures and instructions
as to how he should govern, bidding
him, above all things, to be <em>amiable</em>.
This was not much in Charles’s way;
neither did his political views at all
agree with those of his Holiness Clement
IV. He was certainly by no
means amiable, and, moreover, he
committed a grievous blunder, common
enough with his countrymen,
and which alienated the affections of
his subjects. He tried to Frenchify
his new dominions. Obstinately bent
on moving the mountain, he would not
even meet it half-way. He scorned
to take a lesson from the Norman
founders of the kingdom, who “governed
Sicily not as conquerors but as
old hereditary sovereigns,” and were
cautious of the too sudden introduction
of foreign innovations. His object,
according to M. de St Priest’s own
showing, was at least as much the increase
of the power and importance of
France, as the happiness of the people
he had come to reign over. His historian
admires him for this, and for his
wish “to make half Europe, not a
vassal, but a dependency of France.”
He introduced the forms of French
administration, abolished the offices
and etiquette that had existed since
the days of King Roger, and replaced
them by those of the court of Vincennes,
changes which excited great
hatred and dislike to their author.
He abandoned the Castel Capuano,
the residence of Frederick II., and
built the Castel Nuovo, on the model
of the Paris Bastile. The copy has
survived the original. But we must
pass over, for the present, the merits
and errors of Charles, and his ambitious
designs upon Italy and the East,
to bring upon the scene the last heir of
the house of Stauffen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Conrad, known in history by the
diminutive of Conradin,<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> was born at
Landshut, in Bavaria, on the 25th of
March 1252, and was hailed in his
cradle by the high-sounding titles of
king of Jerusalem and Sicily, king of
the Romans, future emperor, &#38;c. Not
one of these imaginary crowns did he
ever enjoy; even his paternal heritage
was wrested from him whilst yet an
infant; the grandson of Frederick II.
knew want and poverty, and was
more than once indebted to faithful
friends and adherents for a roof to
cover his head. The events of his
life were as remarkable as the years
composing it were few. “Born in
1252, he died in 1268. The interval
embraces but sixteen years, and yet
that short period is animated by all
the passions, emotions, and tumult of
a virile mind. We find in it, in a
high degree, ambition, courage, friendship,
and, in a more doubtful perspective—love.
In reality, Conradin had
no childhood. His life had nothing to
do with the laws regulating human
growth. From the cradle his existence
was one of agitation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An anecdote, whose truth modern
writers have contested, but to which
M. de St Priest gives credit, confirms,
in conjunction with many other circumstances,
the child’s extraordinary
precocity of intelligence and feeling.
Considering his mother as widow of
an emperor, although his father had
never legally borne the imperial title,
since he had not been crowned at
Rome, Conradin treated her with the
utmost ceremony and observance of
etiquette. Suddenly, weary of living
in dependence at the court of her
brother, Louis the Severe, Duke of
Bavaria, Queen Elizabeth-Margaret
married Meinhard de Gorice, brother
of the Count de Tirol, and from queen
became a mere countess.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> This alliance,
unequal but not low, greatly
shocked Conradin: in the words of
a chronicler, he was moved by it
beyond power of expression, and
from that moment he abstained from
paying his mother the usual honours.
She asked him the reason. “Mother,”
replied Conradin, “I rendered you
the homage due to an emperor’s
widow; now you are married to
one less than him, and I, a king and
an emperor’s son, can no longer render
you the honours due to an empress.”
He who spoke this was but
seven years old, and hence many
writers have treated the words as fiction.
But it must be borne in mind
that from his very cradle he had been
nourished with the hopes of his party,
whose pretensions and dreams of triumph
had been unceasingly instilled
into him. The talk of all around him
had been of sceptres to reconquer, victories
to win, rebels to chastise; and
the pathetic but deceitful picture of an
oppressed people, sighing for his return,
had been kept continually before
his eyes. Every act of his life was
premature. Brought up in a political
hot-bed, he showed early symptoms
of imperfect mental growth, and was
crushed and annihilated by the first
storm. Whilst yet a very young child,
he was surrounded by the empty
forms of sovereignty, and made to
think himself both a man and a king.
His uncle and stepfather dragged him
from town to town, dressed in regal
robes, and compelled him to hold provincial
diets. Whilst thus parading,
they unscrupulously despoiled him.
Before he was ten years old, the Duke
of Bavaria made him sign a will bequeathing
to him the whole of his possessions,
in case of his death without
heirs.  Even this did not satisfy the
greedy Bavarian, who soon afterwards
extracted from him, by manner of
donation, some of his richest domains in
Rhineland and the Palatinate. The
example found imitators.  Princes,
bishops, cities, and abbeys fell tooth
and nail upon the heritage of the unfortunate
child. The bishops of Augsburg
and Constance, the counts of
Wurtemburg, the burgraves of Nuremberg,
the king of Bohemia, and
several others, shared the spoils.
The houses of Austria and Prussia
date their rise from that time—the
nucleus of the two monarchies was
formed by fragments of Conradin’s
dominions; and the whole of Germany
as it now appears, in its kingdoms
and divisions, may be traced back to
the fragments of this total wreck and
infamous spoliation. Thus plundered,
nothing remained but to start the
victim on his travels; a royal Quixote
in search of a crown. At first he
showed small disposition to such an adventure,
and more than one deputation
of Ghibellines, and even of Guelfs,
departed unsuccessful from before the
young king’s footstool; until at last
Gualvano Lancia, Mainfroy’s relative
and faithful adherent, and Corrado
and Marino Capece, presented themselves
at the gate of the ancient castle
of Hohenschwangau. Lancia had been
amnestied after the battle of Benevento,
at the request of the Pope, but
much against the will of Charles of
Anjou. He took the oaths to the
new king, but soon afterwards left the
kingdom, and now appeared before
Conradin as deputy from the whole
body of Ghibellines, which had reconstituted
itself throughout the entire
kingdom of the Sicilies, and sent to
the grandson of the Emperor Frederick
assurances of its devotion, the
promise of an army, and considerable
sums of money. Lancia was
the bearer of one hundred thousand
gold florins. Thus was it, says the
chronicler, Saba Malaspina, that the
little sleeping dog was roused up: “<i><span lang="la">ad
suscitandum catulum dormientem</span></i>.” In
spite of the tears and entreaties of his
mother, who had a foreboding of his
fate, and urged him to remain with
her, Conradin published a lengthy
manifesto, asserting his rights to the
crown of Sicily, put himself at the
head of ten thousand men, hired by
Ghibelline gold, and entered Italy,
full of confidence, hope, and enthusiasm,
accompanied by his bosom friend,
Frederick, Duke of Austria, son of
the Margrave of Baden, and followed
by the Duke of Bavaria, and by other
nobles, who promised him support,
but shamefully abandoned him at
Verona, upon the most absurd and
frivolous pretexts. The poor boy was
born to be every body’s dupe. He
believed implicitly the hypocritical
professions of his treacherous kinsman,
made over to him one of the last
shreds of his German possessions, and
parted from him with tears in his eyes,
remaining alone at Verona, with Frederick
of Austria, who was only three
years his senior, for sole ally—his
troops reduced by the defection of
his uncle and the others to about three
thousand men. Instead of marching
at once to Pisa, and taking ship for
Sicily, whose inhabitants were ripe
for insurrection, he sent Corrado Capece
thither, and himself lingered two
months in total inaction. Pisa was
devoted to the house of Swabia; Capece
had no difficulty in obtaining a
galley (Conradin would have found
a fleet as easily), and after calling at
Tunis for the Spanish Infante Don
Fadrique, with four hundred Spaniards
and Saracens, he landed at
Sciacca, gained an advantage over
the French, and saw the greater part
of Sicily declare for Conradin. After
a while, Conradin, having raised
money from the Ghibelline towns,
and recruited his forces, moved forward
to Pavia; whilst Charles of
Anjou, advancing northward to meet
his rival, entered Pisa sword in hand,
upset its towers and ruined its port.
It would lead us too far, and be of no
great interest, to trace the singular
complications of Italian affairs at this
moment, and the perplexities of the
Pope, who was at least as jealous of
the abode of Charles in Tuscany, as
of the feeble attempt of the old German
dynasty to regain its seat upon
the Neapolitan throne. We must
confine ourselves to the career of
Conradin, and follow his fortunes,
now drawing to a lamentable close.
There was a bright flash, however,
before the final setting of his star.
He occupied Pisa—still the first port
in Italy—in spite of the devastations
of Charles of Anjou; on all sides the
Ghibelline party raised its head, and
his enterprise assumed a serious aspect.
Clement IV. became alarmed, and
sent, for the third time, an order to
Conradin to lay down his arms, and
appear in person before the pontifical
chair to justify his conduct, under
pain of all manner of excommunication.
Conradin, who seems to have
inherited a wholesome contempt for
the Pope, replied by despatching a
fleet of four-and-twenty Pisan galleys
to Sicily. This was another blunder.
He should have gone himself, with
all his forces, and certain success
awaited him. Charles of Anjou absent,
his troops dispersed and surprised,
Sicily was lost to the French
dynasty. But Conradin, like a child
as he was, thought only of a triumphant
march on Rome and Naples.
For a paltry pageant, he threw away
a kingdom. Whilst his adherents
gained ground in Sicily, Apulia, Calabria,
and other provinces, he nullified
their advantages by folly and
delay. His only forced marches were
upon the road to ruin. A successful
but unimportant ambuscade, in which
fifty of the enemy were cut off, completely
turned his head. The prisoners
were conducted in triumph to
Sienna; and Conradin and his army,
brimful of confidence, scoffing at pontifical
anathemas, and followed by a
crowd of Ghibellines which every hour
augmented, marched upon Rome,
taking the longest route by way of
Viterbo, in order to show themselves
to Clement IV., then resident in that
city. They passed under its walls,
crowned with verdure and flowers,
more like bacchanals and vintagers
than men-at-arms. From the window
of his palace Clement witnessed
the loose array. “Behold!” said he,
“the sheep led to the slaughter!”
The prelates surrounding him remained
silent, in respectful doubt.
The pontiff, penetrating their thoughts,
persisted in his assertion. “Truly,”
he said, “in eight days nothing will
remain of that army.” His firm
voice, his imposing countenance, his
fervent piety, impressed the hearers
with a conviction that he spoke prophetically.
The event justified the
prediction, the result of political
clear-sightedness rather than of divine
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Conradin’s reception at Rome completed
his intoxication. He was
accompanied into the city by a chorus
of young girls, singing and tambourine-playing
in the midst of the soldiers.
Magnificently dressed ladies
showed themselves at the windows of
the palaces; the people thronged the
streets. Every where he passed under
triumphal arches, hastily raised
in his honour.  They consisted of
cords tied across the street, and supporting,
instead of the usual garlands
of laurels and flowers, the most
precious objects the Romans possessed;
rich furs and garments,
bucklers, rings, bracelets, arms and
jewellery of all kinds. Amidst public
acclamations in honour of his courage
and beauty, Conradin ascended to
the Capitol, escorted by the most
illustrious Romans of the Imperial
party. What head of sixteen would not
have been turned by such incense! At
last he quitted Rome at the head of
five thousand German and Italian men-at-arms,
and of nine hundred Spanish
cavaliers; surrounded and pressed
on all sides by a clamorous and jubilant
multitude. He had formed a plan
which showed resolution and some
military skill. Instead of marching
to Ceprano, the usual route of the
conquerors of Naples, and in which
direction he was persuaded Charles
(then besieging Lucera) would advance
to meet him, he conceived the
bold project of turning his enemy’s
flank by penetrating into the Abruzzi,
effecting a junction with the Saracens
of Lucera, and thence proceeding to
Naples. But Charles was too old a
soldier to be easily outwitted. Advised
from Rome of Conradin’s departure
and route, he abruptly raised the
siege he was engaged in, and marched
day and night to Aquila, the key of
the Abruzzi. Thence he pushed on
to the heights of Androssano, near the
ruins of the old Roman town of Alba,
and appeared before the astounded
Conradin, who thus suddenly beheld
in his immediate front an enemy he
deemed far in his rear. A day passed
without blows: Charles made a reconnaissance;
Conradin, to frighten
his opponent, to whom the fidelity of
the inhabitants of Aquila was most
important, caused false deputies to be
introduced into his camp, dressed in
municipal robes, and bearing apparently
the keys of their town. Informed
of this event, Charles felt very
uneasy, but concealed his anxiety
from all but three knights, with whom
he set out at nightfall and galloped to
Aquila.  He arrived at midnight;
the inhabitants were asleep.  He
struck upon the gates of the citadel,
and cried with a loud voice, “For
whom do you hold this fort?” “For
King Charles,” replied the sentinel.
“Then open, for I am the king!”
Reassured by the joyful reception he
met, Charles returned to his camp,
weary with a ride that had lasted all
night. But he had little time for
repose. Both armies were early afoot:
on the one side the flower of French
and Provençal chivalry; on the other
a medley of Germans, Spaniards, and
Italians. The forces were very unequal.
Conradin brought 6,000 horsemen
into the field; Charles only half
the number. On both sides were
equal fury, hatred, and eagerness to
commence the fray. Charles of Anjou’s
audacity and impetuosity might
possibly have had disastrous results,
but for the opportune arrival of
Erard de Valéry, constable of Champagne,
his earliest friend and companion
in arms. “Erard was then
very old, but still full of vigour. His
colossal stature, herculean vigour, and
white hair gave him resemblance to
the centenary giant of an Arabian
tale. Formerly he had refused to
become a priest, that he might remain
in the society of princes and noble
ladies. Now, a true Christian soldier,
he lived only in God. The old chevalier
was on his way from the Holy
Land, returning to France with a
hundred good knights in his train.
Whilst traversing the kingdom of
Naples, he heard of the king’s presence,
and would not proceed without
visiting him.” Charles urged him to
take part in the approaching fight.
Erard refused, alleging his age, his
wish to die in peace far from human
turmoil, and, finally, a vow to fight
only against infidels. Charles overruled
all objections, replying to the
last one that his opponents were
excommunicated, and consequently
worse than infidels. Then the wary
old chief arranged an ambush, which
would have been utterly unsuccessful
with an ordinarily prudent foe,
but which answered well enough with
the unlucky Conradin, who had not
even made the necessary reconnaissances.
Charles, who had great deference
for the Sire de Valéry, willingly
put himself under his orders, leaving
him the direction of all things. The
army was divided into three bodies,
of which the strongest, commanded
by Charles himself, was placed in
ambush behind a hill in rear of
the Neapolitan position. The other
two, sent forward against Conradin,
were beaten and cut to pieces, after
a combat that lasted from sunrise till
six in the evening. Henry de Cousance,
a French marshal, who resembled
Charles in stature and appearance,
and who, with a purple mantle
over his armour and a crown upon his
helm, took post in the centre of the
army, to personate the king, was
killed early in the action. “Meanwhile
Charles of Anjou, in ambuscade
with Erard de Valéry and his eight
hundred knights, trembled with rage.
Burning with eagerness to strike in,
he rode up and down in rear of the
hill, like a lion in his cage; he was
dying with impatience and grief,
(<i><span lang="it">moriva di dolore</span></i>, says Villani, <i><span lang="it">vedendo
la sua gente cosi barattare</span></i>.)
With inflamed eyes, he from time to
time looked Valéry in the face, thus
silently demanding permission to show
himself and fight. He might have
foreseen the massacre of his two
squadrons. The plan of battle adopted
was likely to entail this disaster.
But what he had not foreseen
was that it would be impossible
for him to support such a
sight.” When the gallant Cousance
fell, pierced with a thousand blows,
and Conradin’s army made the welkin
ring with exulting shouts of
“Victory! the tyrant is dead!”
Charles wept with rage. But his
promise to Valéry chained him to his
rock of agony. What follows is
highly romantic and chivalrous. The
knights who surrounded him said,
‘So noble a fate is it to die for the
justice of a royal cause, that we would
infinitely rejoice thus to lose our lives.
Be well assured, sire, that we will
follow you every where, even to
death.’ With feverish impatience
they waited the signal of Erard de
Valéry, who remained imperturbable.
Suddenly Guillaume de l’Estendard
(one of the commanders of the troops
already engaged) crossed the battle-field
at speed, feigning to fly, in order
to draw the Spaniards on. They
followed. Then the old knight raised
his enormous head and gigantic person
above the brow of the little hill,
and said to the King, ‘<i><span lang="fr">Marchons!</span></i>’
Charles was off like a dart, followed by
Valéry and the eight hundred chevaliers;
they swept across the plain, and
found Conradin, Gualvano Lancia, and
Frederick of Austria seated unhelmed
and unarmed on the bank of the little
river Salto, like conquerors reposing;
whilst the German mercenaries were
dispersed in search of booty, stripping
the dead and loading the spoils on
carts. Charles and his reserve of fresh
and picked men had a cheap bargain
of them, as also of the Spaniards, who
were taken prisoners, on their return
from the pursuit of Estendard, almost
to a man. A complete victory, alloyed
only by a heavy loss of brave and devoted
followers, remained to Charles
of Anjou. “Such,” says M. de St
Priest, “was the celebrated battle of
Alba, improperly named the battle of
Tagliacozzo, after a village more than
six miles from the scene of action. It
is one of those deeds of arms of which
history will ever preserve the memory,
less on account of the greatness of the
result, than for the dramatic interest
attaching to the quarrel and the men.
On the one hand we see a young prince
in the flush of youth and brilliant valour,
full of conviction of his good right,
the noblest and most unfortunate of
pretenders; on the other, a warrior
terrible even to ferocity, but not less
convinced of the legitimacy of his
cause, one of the greatest princes, and,
beyond contradiction, the greatest
captain of his time.” M. de St Priest
proceeds to attribute the chief merit
of the victory to his hero. “In this
bloody game at bars, full of snares,
traps, surprises, where we see these
terrible condottieri, covered with
blood, running after each other like
schoolboys at play, success was due
less to the odd stratagem of Valéry
than to the rapid march, the four days’
race in the mountains, from Lucera to
Aquila. If Charles showed himself a
great general, it was less when in
ambuscade behind the hill of Capello,
than when, like a bird of prey hovering
above the wild Abruzzi, he fell
with a swoop upon the imprudent
band, who deemed him astray in the
defiles, lost in the ravines, or fallen
amongst precipices.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Conradin, his army destroyed,
his hopes shattered, was a
fugitive, with scarcely a follower.
One or two days he abode in Rome,
protected by the Ghibellines; then,
driven forth by the return of the
Guelfs, consequent on the ruin of his
cause, he fled with Frederick of Austria
and a few Italian nobles, to the
sea-coast, near the castle of Astura, a
fortress of the Frangipani family.
Hiring a boat, they set sail for Pisa,
but were pursued and overtaken by a
fast galley, whose commander summoned
them to bring to, and ordered
the passengers to repair to his quarter-deck.
Conradin asked in astonishment
who this man was, and heard
in reply that it was Giovanni Frangipani,
master of the neighbouring
castle. At this name Conradin was
overjoyed. “Giovanni is a Roman,”
he said; “his family have always been
devoted to the house of Swabia; they
have been loaded with benefits by the
Emperor Frederick; a Frangipani
will assuredly defend and befriend
me.” Full of confidence, he went on
board the galley. “I am King Conrad
V.,” was his hasty speech to the
lord of Astura, “and I have sought
to reconquer the kingdom of my ancestors.”
Frangipani made no reply:
the prince was astonished at his
silence, asked him to assist his flight,
descended at last to entreaties, offered,
it is said, to marry his daughter; but
the stern pirate remained mute, and
on reaching land, threw the prince and
his companions into a dungeon. Delivered
up to Charles, they were led
to Rome on foot and in chains. “Oh,
my mother!” cried Conradin, with
bitter tears, “you foretold this, and I
was deaf to your words. Oh, my mother!
what grief for your old age!”
He did nothing but sob the whole of
the road, Saba Malaspina tells us, and
seemed half dead, and as if out of his
senses. But this weakness, which, in
such misfortune and in a mere child,
was not unnatural, soon gave way to
tranquil fortitude and Christian resignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ashes of the fires lighted in
Rome to celebrate Conradin’s triumphant
passage had scarcely cooled,
when he re-entered the walls of the
Eternal City, a fettered captive marching
to his doom. Thence he was taken
to Naples, where an imposing and
numerous tribunal assembled to judge
him.  Many of its members were
for a mild punishment, some for
none at all; others remained silent;
one only opined for the death of the
accused. But Charles had determined
on his young rival’s destruction; he
threw his word and influence into the
scale, and sentence of decapitation
was pronounced on Conradin of Swabia,
Frederick of Baden, known as
Duke of Austria, and the barons taken
in their company. The two princes
had not expected such severity, and
were playing at chess in their prison
when it was announced to them. They
piously confessed, were absolved by
the Pope, who relented at this extreme
moment, and were led to the scaffold,
which was covered with a red cloth
in honour of the victims’ royal blood.
The executioner was there, with naked
arms and feet, and axe in hand. Conradin
embraced him, having previously
done the same by his friend Frederick
and the other sufferers—then laid his
head upon the block. When the axe
rose, the French chevaliers who stood
around the scaffold fell upon their
knees and prayed; and as they did so,
the head of Conradin rolled upon the
crimson cloth. At this sight the Duke
of Austria started up as if crazed with
despair; he was seized and executed,
uttering horrible cries. This butchery
at last roused the indignation of the
French knights. Robert de Béthune
threw himself upon the prothonotary,
who had read Conradin’s sentence, and
with a blow of his sword cast him
down half dead from his platform.
This strange and unreasonable act,
proceeding from a generous but savage
impulse, was greatly applauded by the
spectators. Even Charles himself was
compelled to feign approval of his
son-in-law’s violence.</p>

<p class='c009'>No funeral honours were paid to
Conradin and his companions. They
were buried secretly in the sand, on
the shore of the sea, at the mouth of
the river Sebeto. Of their captivity,
judgment, and death, M. de St Priest
declares himself to have given, with
the fidelity of a conscientious historian,
an exact and truthful account.
At the same time, he subjoins various
details that have obtained more or
less credence, but which he treats as
fables. It has been said, that when
Conradin embarked at Astura, he gave
a ring in payment of his passage; that
the boatmen who received the jewel
took it to Frangipani, and that the
fugitive was recognised and arrested
upon this romantic indication. According
to traditions, the Duke of Austria
was executed the first, and Conradin
kissed his head, which, all severed and
bleeding as it was, still invoked the
Holy Virgin. Robert de Béthune
killed, it has been affirmed, the prothonotary
Robert de Bari, whose signature
is found, however, in many
subsequent acts. And to crown all
these marvels, it has been confidently
asserted that, after the execution of
the two princes, a masked stranger
stabbed the headsman. Very recent
and trustworthy writers have recorded
as fact, that Conradin, just before receiving
the fatal blow, threw a glove
amongst the crowd, to be taken to
Peter of Arragon, to whom he bequeathed
his vengeance and crown.
A German chevalier, Truchsess de
Waldburg, (M. de St Priest calls him
Waldburg de Truchsess,) gathered up
the gage, and with much risk and
difficulty bore it to its destination.
The present historian discredits the
whole of this glove-story—a fiction, he
says, of the invention of Sylvius
Piccolomini. He is more unwilling
to doubt the following touching tradition:—“One
day the inhabitants of
Naples beheld in their bay a vessel of
strange form and colour; hull, sails,
and rigging were all black. A woman
in deep sables left the ship,—it
was Queen Elizabeth-Margaret, Conradin’s
mother. At the rumour of her
son’s captivity she embarked all her
treasures, and, gaining intrepidity
from her maternal love, this Elizabeth,
previously so feeble and fearful that
she dared not leave her castles in
Swabia and the Tyrol, exposed herself
to the perils of the sea, as bearer
of her child’s ransom. But it was
too late. When she reached Naples,
Conradin was dead. Then the unhappy
mother implored a single favour:
she desired to erect a monument to
him she wept, on the spot where he
had perished. Charles would not
consent, although he authorised the
erection of a church upon the place of
execution, and contributed a considerable
sum towards the work,—an expiatory
offering which, in conjunction with
the useless ransom, attested at once
the grief of an inconsolable mother,
and the tardy remorse of a pitiless
victor.” The church is to be seen at
Naples, upon the square of Santa
Maria del Carmine; beneath its altar
is the tomb, with its inscription; the
statue of Elizabeth stands there with
a purse in its hand. Surely this is
confirmation strong of the truth of the
tradition! Unfortunately, church, inscription,
and statue are all of a recent
date.</p>

<p class='c009'>The events just detailed left Charles
of Anjou at the pinnacle of power
and greatness. The magnitude of the
danger he had run added to the lustre
of his triumph. Nothing now resisted
him; he might almost be styled the
master of Italy.  Every where the
Guelfs drove the Ghibellines before
them; every where the Swabian eagle
fled before the red and silver lilies.
The cause of the Ghibellines was lost.
The fortunate conqueror was on every
point successful. His domestic prosperity
kept pace with his political and
military success. Charles, then forty-two
years old, beheld himself surrounded
by a numerous posterity.
He had two sons and three daughters.
His queen, Beatrix of Provence, was
dead; but soon he contracted a second
marriage with the young and beautiful
Margaret of Burgundy. Nature
herself seemed to favour him; for in
the short space of three years, all his
enemies, in any way formidable, disappeared
from the scene. Amongst
others, the valiant and adventurous
Corrado Capece, taken prisoner by the
implacable Guillaume de l’Estendard,
had his eyes put out, and was hung
upon a gibbet of extraordinary altitude,
erected for the purpose upon the
coast of Catania. The Saracens of
Lucera still held out. Besieged by a
powerful army, with Charles at its
head, they resisted for six months,
till reduced to eat hay and roots.
The bodies of stragglers from the
town being opened by the besiegers,
only grass was found in their bellies.
At last they gave in. Charles, with
a wise policy, showed them mercy,
contenting himself with banishing
them from Lucera, and distributing
them amongst the towns of the interior.
Although the piety of the first
French king of Sicily was carried almost
to an exaggerated extent, it did
not degenerate into fanaticism; at
least not into that fanaticism which
engenders persecution. He never
adopted the prejudices of the time
against the Jews; on the contrary,
he delivered them from the hands of
state inquisitors, and suppressed the
distinctive mark they were compelled
to wear upon their garments. Financial
considerations may not improbably
have stimulated, at least as much
as the dictates of reason and humanity,
this enlightened spirit of tolerance;
but still it is to the credit of
Charles that he did not, like many
very Christian kings and nobles of his
and subsequent centuries, smite the
Israelite with one hand whilst stripping
him with the other. The King
of Jerusalem was merciful to his subjects.
Charles it was who first added
this title to that of King of Sicily, by
purchase from the old Princess Mary
of Antioch, who called herself Mademoiselle
de Jerusalem, and claimed
that crown, then little more than a
name. When Charles, for a pension
of four thousand <i><span lang="fr">livres tournois</span></i>, acquired
her rights, he hastened to vindicate
them. They were disputed by
Henry, King of Cyprus, who had the
advantage of possession; for he held
Ptolemais, the last fragment of the
christian kingdom of Palestine. The
Knights of St John supported him;
Venice and the Templars backed
King Charles. The latter carried the
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Master of southern Italy, armed
protector of the north, Charles I. had
no longer aught to check him; the
East was open before him. Already
he occupied a part of Greece. All
that mountainous coast of Albania,
celebrated in our days for the devotedness
of the Suliots, belonged to him by
the death of Helena Comnenus,
Mainfroy’s widow, daughter of the
despot of Thessaly and Epirus. He
also held the island of Corfu, that
natural bridge thrown between Italy
and the East. The town of Durazzo
revolted in his favour, and called him
within its walls. He swayed Achaia and
the Morea, and had constituted himself
candidate for the throne of Constantinople
by marrying his daughter to
Philip de Courtenay, nominal heir to
the Latin Empire, but living in reality
on the alms of his father-in-law. It
seemed, then, that he had nothing to
do but to bid his fleet sail for Byzantium.
But in the midst of his ambitious
projects he was interrupted by
the new crusade, the last undertaken,
got up by Saint Louis, and in which
Charles could not refuse to join. The
death of St Louis terminated the expedition;
and after dictating terms of
peace to the sultan of Tunis, in whose
dominions the adventurers had landed,
their return to Europe, by way of
Sicily, was decided upon. It was not
consistent with Charles’s character to
forget or abandon an enterprise he had
once decided upon; and on landing at
Trapani, he assembled the council of
crusading kings and princes, and proposed
to them to re-embark for Constantinople.
It was a bold and
sagacious idea to take advantage of
this unusual assemblage of naval
forces to establish French power in
the East; but Charles, indefatigable
himself, spoke to disheartened and
disgusted men. All refused, and
Edward Plantagenet (afterwards
Edward I. of England) rejected with
insulting energy his uncle’s proposition,
declaring that he would winter
in Sicily, and afterwards return to
Syria, which he did, without other
result than the wound cured by the
well-known trait of conjugal affection
and courage of the virtuous and
intrepid Eleanor of Castile. Subsequently,
the realisation of Charles’s
ambitious designs upon the East, long
entertained, was continually prevented
by one circumstance or another, until
at last the affairs of Sicily gave him
occupation at home, effectually precluding
aggrandisement abroad. Essentially
a man of war, he nevertheless,
in time of peace, showed skill,
intelligence, and activity in the administration
of the kingdom of Naples.
Had the distant provinces of his dominions
been as well governed, M. de
St Priest affirms that the Two Sicilies
would not, during more than two
centuries, have been sundered and at
enmity. But Charles abandoned the
island Sicily to his lieutenants. He
positively disliked and ill-treated it,
and determined to dispossess Palermo
of its title of capital, in favour of the
city of Naples, of which he was enthusiastically
fond. Palermo was too
devoted to the house of Swabia; and,
moreover, to maintain correspondence
with the north of Italy, with Rome,
and especially with France, it suited
Charles far better to fix his headquarters
and seat of government at
Naples. From the very first moment,
he had been greatly struck by the
aspect of the latter city. The bright
sky and sunny sea and mountain
amphitheatre that still charm and
fascinate the tourist, had a far stronger
effect upon the prince whom conquest
rendered their master. He at once
mentally fixed upon Naples as his
capital, and gradually accomplished
his project—without, however, announcing
it by public declaration, and
even continuing to give to Palermo
the titles establishing its supremacy.
But, whilst retaining the empty name
of superiority, the Sicilian city felt
itself substantially fallen; and this
may have been a cause, and no slight
one, that its inhabitants were the first
to rise in arms against the galling yoke
and insolent neglect of their French
rulers.</p>

<p class='c009'>M. de St Priest’s third volume
brings Charles to the zenith of his
fortunes. Invested for life with the
high dignity of sole Roman senator, he
had the full support and hearty
alliance of Martin IV.—a French
pope, whose election had been compelled
from the conclave by the
intimidation of the sword. It was
the first time since Charles had
entered Italy that the pontifical chair
had been occupied by a man on whose
docility he could entirely reckon.
Papal mistrust and jealousy had been
the bane of many of his projects. All
apprehensions from that quarter were
now removed, and, strong in this holy
alliance, he again prepared for his
eastern expedition. All was ready;
at the head of five thousand men,
without counting infantry, and of a
hundred and thirty ships, he had only
to give the order to steer for the
Bosphorus. But in Sicily, the storm,
long brewing, was on the eve of
bursting forth; and the powerful
armament intended for distant conquest,
was found insufficient to retain
present possessions. The decline of
Charles’s life was also that of his
power: his last days were days of
heaviness, disaster, and grief.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>TRAVELLING IN TAFFYLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>People wander into Wales principally
in search of health and amusement; a
few for business; many
without any purpose whatever, except
the desire of changing place and
doing something.  Any one who finds
himself in either of these classes need
not fear being disappointed in the
results of his visit; for there is motion
and change enough throughout the
country; sufficient business to make
it worth the while of those who know
how to buy and sell; amusement for
all who are worth amusing, and health
enough for all the world. Let no
man, however, deceive himself with
the vain expectation that he shall
have no ups and downs in his pilgrimage
through the country; let no one
suppose that it is perpetual sunshine
there; nor let any one fondly think
that, because he does himself the
honour of whipping a stream with
fly and line, therefore, at every throw
a sixpound trout is sure to swallow
his bait. Far otherwise. The tourist
in Wales must not be a man of many
expectations, and then he will not be
disappointed; he must be content to
go many a weary mile to see some
choice bit of scenery, and then to
come as many or more miles home
again; he must make up his mind to
have plenty of rain, wind and cold,
in the hottest day in summer; and
he may cast his fly all the way up
from Conwy to Penmachno without
having “one single glorious rise.”
In fact, he must be a patient reasonable
man, and then he may adventure
himself in Taffyland without
fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if he is an acute observer of
nature—if he loves to see the wildest
forms that mountains, and streams,
and lakes can assume—if he likes to
make himself a denizen of the clouds,
and to hold converse with the children
of the mist—if he can appreciate primitive
national manners—if he has
ever so small a smattering of English
history—if he can listen to simple,
plaintive music, and can be content to
see birds, beasts, and fishes all enjoying
themselves in their original freedom,
then let him hasten to the mountain
side, wander up the valley, stroll
along the river, or dream away his
day by the shingle bank on the sea
shore; he will never repent of a visit
to Wales.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old road from Chester to Holyhead
has been, and now is more than
ever, the main line of entry for Saxons
and other foreigners into the Cimbric
land; but there are others quite as
good. From Salop to Bangor by
Telford’s Parliamentary road, through
some of the finest scenery the country
affords; or from Wrexham by
Llangollen’s Vale and Bala’s Lake,
athwart the land to Dolgelly; or from
Aberystwyth, creeping along the sea-coast
by Barmouth and Tremadoc to
Caernarvon; or from Liverpool by the
fast-going steamers close under Orme’s
Head to the Menai Bridge; any of
these ways is good. The main thing
is once to get the foot fairly planted
on Welsh soil; the natural attractions
of the country will be sure to lead the
traveller onward, and can scarcely
lead him amiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let no one come into Wales with a
superfluity of luggage; the lighter
the impediments of travelling, the
quicker and the cheaper is that travelling
performed. Let no one, unless
absolutely forced to it, pretend to
travel alone; solitude is sweet no
doubt, but Montaigne remarks that
it is still sweeter if there be somebody
to whisper this to; add to which
that society enlivens the journey, and,
as the Scotch song has it,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>

      <div class='line'>“Company is aye the best, crossing owre the heather.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Seeing too that conveyances are not
so plentiful in the principality as they
might be; and that a car or chaise
costs no more for four than it does
for one; let all those who are wise
in their designs of Welsh travel come
by pairs, or double couples. Four
is an excellent number for a travelling
party, since in case of dispute the
votes are either even, or are three to
one; four make up a <i><span lang="fr">parti carré</span></i> at
dinner; four balance a car well; four
can split into two parties if need be;
and four coming together to an inn
are sure to fare much better than one
solitary traveller.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’t go to Wales in July, the wettest
and windiest month of the twelve
that the principality has the honour
of knowing. May is a sweet month;
the colours of the woods and mountains
gay and delicate, with little rain,
and generally as much sun as is
wanted. In June, every thing is in
full perfection, and there are long
days to boot, and you may then remain
out under a rock all night without
damage. August corresponds to
June, but the days are shorter, and
the company to be met with is commonly
more select. September is generally
the equivalent of May, but
the colours are glowing with the rich
tints of autumn; and though the days
are still shorter, yet the sights to be
seen in them will make up for this
falling off. No person goes among
the mountains in winter, except those
who cannot help it; yet this is not
their least advantageous period for
being witnessed; and those who can
brave frost and snow, and the unchained
force of all the winds of
heaven, will be repaid for the labours
and discomforts of such a visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>For those who are fond of the rod,
the gun, and the chase, North Wales
is a land of choice. Whether they
bob for whales in Bardsey Sound,
or hunt up the brooks and prattling
streams of Merionethshire, or seek
the banks of many a glassy mountain
pool, they will find enough to repay
them for their trouble. The shooter
will find, from the grouse of Montgomeryshire
and Caernarvonshire to the
partridges and the snipes of Anglesey,
abundant occupation for his gun. And
the huntsman, though he cannot gallop
over Caddir-Idris, will find many
a wily fox more than a match for him
and all his dogs, among the desolate
cairns of the mountain tops, or may
find hares as big as sheep, and fleet
enough to try the mettle of the best
horse he will dare to ride after
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whenever a tourist wishes to pass
his summer months healthily and
agreeably, but is in doubt whither to
go, let him start off for Wales—North
Wales—forthwith; and let him not
return till wood and water, and hill
and dale have ceased to call forth his
admiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not trust too implicitly to guidebooks,
good traveller; take them and
consult them; but beware of their
lying propensities. They have inveigled
many a loving subject of her
Majesty’s into a scrape, and have
proved the dearest things he ever
admitted into his pocket. Go with
your eyes open; go with a little common
sense; go to be pleased: don’t
go to find fault. Make up your mind
to rough it if need be; and don’t give
yourself the airs of my Lord Duke at
every little wayside inn that your
dignity may be forced to put up at.
You may then travel smoothly and
cheerfully through the Cimbric territory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take also this along with you. The
Welsh are tremendously slow coaches.
Indolent, pig-headed, and careless,
the <i><span lang="it">dolce far niente</span></i> is their motto
throughout life; and, were they left
to themselves, they would positively
retrograde through unwillingness to
go a-head. It is of no use hurrying
them; a Welshman was never in a
hurry in his life; time, like water, is to
him of little value; he has plenty and
to spare of it, and the waste of either
commodity is not thought of. In
Wales, they let both run away often
to little purpose; they have fewer
“water privileges” than any one
could imagine; and they turn their
privilege of an <em>ad libitum</em> supply of
leisure to very poor account. So do
not hurry a Welshman; for you will
not gain any of <em>his</em> time, but will
only lose some of your own, by so
doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The true way to enjoy Wales, and
to understand the country, is to go
and fix your quarters at some quiet
little country inn in a spot to your
taste; and remain there for a fortnight—a
month—or as long as your
<em>gusto</em> endures; walking up the whole
country around, until you know every
crook and cranny of it, until it becomes
in fact your “ancient neighbourhood.”
Many, or rather innumerable
are the spots where you may
so fix yourself, and where your enjoyments,
though simple, may be extreme.
If you are a bachelor, you can
get clean beds, sheets of driven snow,
plenty of good milk, mountain mutton,
and bread and butter <i><span lang="fr">à discrétion</span></i>;
and what the deuce does a man want
more? If he is young, and in good
health and spirits, and cannot fare
upon this, let him put up his traps
and go to the antipodes. Or, if you
are in the softer predicament of having
with you what, when you and I were
young, you know, used to be called
<i><span lang="la">poetice</span></i>, the “girl of your heart”—but
what now in Polichinellic phraseology
is termed the “wife of your bussum”—why,
even in this extremity, you may
find room for two in any inn that you
venture to light upon. The lady
must not be too fine in her notions, it
is true; she must be of that breed
and mettle that will enable her to
face the mountain breeze, and wipe
with hasty foot—as friend Gray says,—the
dews of the upland lawn; to
meet the sun or the moon, or any
other natural phenomenon that is to
be encountered on the hill-side. In
short, she must be the sort of girl that
can mount a rough pony, or scramble
over a stone wall, and not care for
her bonnet or her locks in a pelting
shower, but must be content to follow
her liege lord, and love him—and
love his pursuits too, whether by the
purling brook, or on the misty height.
Be sure of it, my friend, that with
such a companion as this, Welsh
scenery—mountain scenery—nay, <em>any</em>
scenery, will have for you a double—ay,
a tenfold charm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Men enjoy mountains: women enjoy
waterfalls. There is no saying why
it is; but the fact is positive. Perhaps
it may be that men can toil up the
rugged steep with greater ease, and
therefore enjoy themselves the more
when they reach the top. Perhaps it
is that there is something grand, and
bold, and rough, and dangerous, in
the very nature of a mountain, which
the masculine mind is alone capable
of fully understanding. In waterfalls,
there is all the beauty of form, and
light and graceful motion, and harmonious
sound, and cooling freshness,
and ever-changing variety that woman
always loves; and there are overshadowing
trees, and an escape from
the noontide sun, and the hum of
insect life, and moss-grown stones,
and soft grassy banks. Waterfalls
and their adjuncts have a kind of
mystic influence about them that acts
with all-persuasive energy on the
female mind: hearts like stones are
worn down by their action, and the
swain has often been indebted to
the Naiad for the granting of his
prayer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well; wherever you may be,
whether single or double, any where
in Wales, the first thing to do is to
make a bargain with your landlady,
(Welsh inns are always kept by
women,) whereby you may be
“boarded and lodged and done for”
at so much a day, or a week, or a
month, or whatever time it may
please you to stay. This is the very
best of all plans for “taking your
pleasure in your inn;” you know
then the exact cost of your stay—the
precise damage done to your pocket;
you dine comfortably, without fearing
that you are swallowing a five shilling
piece in the midst of each chop,
and you can witness the last day of
your sojourn arrive without dread of
that unpleasant winding up—the bill.
You may get boarded and lodged
comfortably, nay luxuriously, as far
as mountain luxury goes, for a
pound a-week: you may take your
full swing of the house for this; and
your landlady will ask for a repetition
of the honour next year when you
depart. So let no man say that living
in Wales is extravagant; it is
only the <i><span lang="fr">savoir vivre</span></i> that is the scarce
commodity.</p>

<p class='c009'>And if you would know where to
go and find comfortable quarters of
this kind, and at this rate, then take
our advice, gentle reader, and listen
to a few experiences. Go to Bala,
and fish the lake there till not a trout
is left in it, and cut away at mine
host’s mutton and beef, when you
come back from your day’s excursion,
as though you had not eaten for a
week; and turn in by ten at night,—not
later, mind; and be up again by
five, and out on the mountain side,
or amid the woods by six, and home
again by seven to your morning fare.
So shall you have health and happiness,
and freedom from ennui the
livelong day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or go to Ffestiniog, up among its
mountains, and ramble over to the
lakes below Snowdon, and visit the
company at Beddgelert and Tan-yBwlch—rather
aristocratic places in
their way, and made for travellers
with long purses. At Ffestiniog you
are in the neighbourhood of the best
mountain scenery of Wales; and as
for vales and streams, you have
such as you will never see elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or else go to Bettws-y-Coed near
Llanrwst, the village of the confluence
of so many streams and valleys;
that sweet woodland scene, that
choice land of waterfalls, and sunny
glades, and wood-clad cliffs. Here
you may have variety of scenery in
the greatest perfection; and here you
may enjoy the happiest admixture
of the wild and the beautiful that the
principality can boast of. It is indeed
a lovely spot; and, provided
the visitor has some intellectual resources
and amusements within himself,
one that the tourist can never
get tired of. It will bear visiting
again and again. <i><span lang="la">Decies repetita
placebit.</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'>But, dear sir, if you are bent upon
making the grand tour, and if you
positively will see the whole of the
country, then by all means start from
Chester, and make a continual round
until you arrive at Shrewsbury; so
shall you see the whole length and
breadth,—the bosom and the very
bowels of the land. You must go and
see Conwy, Penmaen Mawr, and “the
Bridge,” as it is still emphatically
called—Telford’s beautiful exemplification
of the catenary curve—and
then go and hunt out Prince Edward’s
natal room in Caernarvon’s towers;
and then clamber up Snowdon;
and then go down again to Capel
Curig and Beddgelert, and so pass by
Pont Aberglaslyn to Tan-y-Bwlch,
Ffestiniog and Dolgelly; and then
mount Cadair Idris; and then run up
to Bala and Llangollen, and so
stretch away to the abode of the
“proud Salopians.” And a very
agreeable tour you will have made,
no doubt; but you will not know
Wales for all that. You have not
been along the byeways, nor over the
dreary heath, nor into the river’s
bed, nor under the sea-crag’s height:
you will not have seen a tithe of the
wonders of the country. You must
see all these great places of course:
but you ought to look after much
more than this; you must wander
over the broad lands of the Vale of
Clwyd, and look up all its glorious
little trout streams; you must go to
the solitary heights of Carnedd
Llewelyn, and the Glidr above Nant
Francon; and you must get up to
Llyn Idwal, and have nerve enough
to climb over and under the rocks of
the Twll Du; and you must go to
the very end of Llŷn, or else you will
never know what it is to lie down
flat at the edge of the Parwyd precipice,
and look down six hundred
feet sheer into the sea, with not a
blade of grass nor a stone between
you and the deep blue waters fresh
from the Atlantic. And you must
climb over the bleak Merionethshire
hills to seaward, and hunt up the
lonely fishing pools that abound in
their recesses; and you must dive into
the green wooded valleys of Montgomeryshire,
and learn whence the
Severn draws all its peat-brown
waters. There is occupation enough
in this for the longest summer that
ever yet shone on Wales; you may
start on your pilgrimage with the
first green bud of spring, and end it
with the sere and yellow leaf of
autumn: but it is only in such lengthened
and lonely rambles as these that
the real beauties of the country are
to be seen, and that the full loveliness
of nature—unsophisticated nature—is
to be perceived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take your fishing rod with you,
take your sketch book; explore the
whole country; bring it away with
you both in mind and on paper:
leave care and trouble behind you;
banish all reminiscences of town; go
and be a dweller with the birds and
the dumb animals, with the leaves
and the stones, with the oak in the
forest and the carn on the mountain,
and gain thereby a fund of health
and satisfaction, that shall endure for
many a long day and year, nor be
exhausted even then.</p>

<p class='c009'>You are too old a traveller, we
will suppose, to need many instructions
as to the general apparatus required;
only mind and err rather on
the side of scantiness than otherwise;
you can get all you really want
at the first town you come to. Who
is the rash man that would risk a
good hat or a good coat on a Welsh
mountain? Alas! he shall soon know
the end of his gear, and lament over
the loss of his pence. The very idea
of going into cloud-land with anything
on that you care about spoiling, or
rather that can by any possibility be
spoiled! Is it not your privilege,
your aim, your pride, when you get
among the mountains, to be able to
go right on end, through stream and
bog, over rock and swamp, without
stopping to think of habilimentary
consequences? You may tell an old
traveller by the “cut of his jib;” it is
only your thorough cockney that
comes down in his new green shooting
coat, and his bright shepherd’s plaid
trowsers, just out of the tailor’s
hands, and a hat with the shine not
yet taken out of it. Look at that
tall, thin, bony, sinewy man, going
along the road there with an easy
gait, neither stiff nor lax, neither
quick nor slow, but always uniform,
whether up hill or down hill, or on
level ground, always at the same
pace; his knees never tightened, his
instep never approaching to a hop;
but in all weathers and in all seasons,
over rough or smooth, never falling
under three nor quite coming up to
four miles an hour. And look at his
low-crowned felt hat,—he wears a
Jim-Crow one, by the way, in very
hot weather,—why, you would not
give it to a pig-driver, so brown and
battered it seems: and look at his
funny little coat; neither a coat nor
a jacket,—neither black, nor brown,
nor blue, but a mixture of all
colours, just as the rain may have
been pleased to leave portions of its
dye remaining. And his trowsers,
shrunk to mid-leg proportions, are
just covering the tops of his gaiters,
yet allowing a bit of his gray worsted
socks to appear. A stout stick which
he twirls merrily in his hand, and a
light leathern wallet, not bigger than
your letter-bag, thrown over one
shoulder,—or else his fishing-basket
coming snugly under his elbow. He
is the true pedestrian,—he is the
ancient traveller,—he is the lover of
the Cymro and the Cymraeg,—he is
the man that enjoys himself thoroughly
in Wales.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once upon a time, dear friend,
we found ourselves coming over
Moel Siabod, that wild and beautiful
hill rising over the eastern side of
Capel Curig; swinging away in our
simplicity of heart, and purposing to
reach the lonely fastness of Dolwyddelan
by noon, on a piping hot July
day. We had crowned the mountain
ridge, and had come half-way down
the eastern slope, when we found
ourselves at the edge of a great peat
bog, with never a path, nor a stone,
nor any thing to guide us through it.
Beyond and below it lay the valley
for which we were making, green,
smiling, and beautiful, as Welsh
valleys generally are. Above and
behind us rose the bare crags of the
mountain, darkening into a purple
crest as their summits reached the
fleecy clouds. We had nothing to do
but to adopt the glorious old rule of
following our nose; and so, without
further ado, we tried to pick our way
across the bog. We have a reminiscence
of sundry skippings from
tuft to tuft of heather, and of wonderful
displays of agility; and at last
we began to congratulate ourselves
on the immense display of juvenile
vigour which we were making. One
more leap on to a fine bright piece
of green grassy sward, and we were
safe. Beyond it lay a ridge of rock
and terra firma to carry us onward.
One more spring and we should
have crossed the bog. So now here
goes for it; three paces backwards, a
good swing with the arms,—one, two,
three, and away!—plump into the
very middle of the green sward,—and
<em>through</em> it, down, down, down,
until our hat and stick alone remained
aloft! Why, ’twas the most treacherous
place of the whole; a kind of
syren’s isle that tempted men to destruction
by the beauty of outward
form,—though beauty of sound, indeed,
there was none. How we got
out has always remained a mystery;
but we floundered and tumbled about,
and cut more extraordinary figures
with our arms than we had done at
any time the last ten days with our
legs, until at length we seemed to
crawl out like a fly out of a treacle
pot, and to attain some drier ground.
Our black velvet shooting coat, and
our nice white ducks had never made
such an approximation of colour
before: we had put on the sad and
sober russet brown in which dame
nature so much delights, and we came
forth from our grassy bed a good
specimen of the tints of the mountain
dye-house. It was enough; our resolution
was taken:—half an hour’s
sharp walking down the descent
brought us to the banks of the Lledr;
we were not five minutes in selecting
a proper spot; and there we immediately
converted ourselves into our
own washerwoman, after the most
primitive fashion that any antenoachite
ever adopted. In another
half hour we were beginning to look
whitish again; and by the end of
the sixty minutes we were clad in
garments on the most approved hydropathic
principles; wet bandages we
had plenty of,—for if any one had
offered us the wealth of India, we
could not at that moment have produced
a single dry thread on our
body. But here our pedestrian resources
again came to our aid; the
sun shone more bright than ever;
we were in the bottom of the valley:
the heat was intense. The village
was still four miles off, and by
the time we arrived abreast of the
welcome notification of “<i><span lang="cy">Cwrw dda</span></i>,”
we were dried, ironed, mangled, folded,
and plaited, more commodiously,
(though less uniformly,) than ever
our buxom little laundress could
have done for us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once and again we got into a
brown predicament in Wales, not so
easily got rid of, nor leaving so few
disagreeable reminiscences. You will
excuse us for mentioning it, if you
please; but our <i><span lang="fr">tableau de mœurs</span></i>
would not be complete without it.
And here we beg leave to give notice
that fastidious readers may at once
close their eyes and read no more, or
else skip over this page and try
another. If they become offended,
‘twill be their own fault; what business
have they to be prying into our
secrets?</p>

<p class='c009'>Once upon a time we did a rash
thing: we made up our mind—and
also our knapsack—to go to Bardsey
Island. Now, ’tis a hundred to one
that you never heard of Bardsey
Island; and that, though your careful
parents may have paid many a
guinea per quarter for you, while at
school, to learn Geography and the
use of the Globes, you never yet were
questioned by your usher as to where
Bardsey Island was, nor what sort of
a place it might be. Know, then,
that it lies, a solitary green isle, some
three miles or so from the extreme
south-western point of Caernarvonshire,—a
sort of <i><span lang="fr">avant-poste</span></i> to Wales,
like the Scilly Isles to Cornwall. On
it live some five-score of inhabitants,
real natives, supporting themselves
on oysters and lobsters, and other
marine monsters. An occasional
dog-fish is there reckoned a luxury.
’Tis a vastly curious place,—the
oddest kinds of sea-birds to be found
there of any spot under the sun,—at
least in these latitudes; the rarest
shells; the most unique sea-weeds;
the greatest pets of periwinkles;
and such loves of limpets! We were
off, then, for Bardsey:—do not go
there, dear reader—take our warning
by the way, and remain rather at
home. We got to a place with a most
out-of-the-way name—Pwllheli; a
sort of <i><span lang="fr">ne plus ultra</span></i> of stupidity and
dulness; and from thence we made
our way in a car to one of more euphonious
denomination, Aberdaron. This
was really a lovely spot, embosomed
in a deep valley, at the corner of a
romantic bay, with an expanse of
snow-white sand, sufficient to accommodate
all the bathers in England,—the
sea of as deep a blue as at Madeira,
and rocks like those of Land’s End,
with the eternal spray of the ocean
playing over them. A picturesque
old church, partly converted into a
school, partly into a pigeon-house—and
the main entry to which was by
one of the windows, stands at one
end of the village with a miserable
pot-house at the other. There is a
stream and a bridge for loungers to
lean and spit over; but other amusement
in the place is none. As for
public accommodation, it has not yet
been thought of; strangers do not
come there. None but the adjoining
boors come thither to sot and gossip;—and
as for our dear mellifluous
Anglo-Saxon tongue, ’tis a thing
never heard of. On arriving there
and exploring the localities, and
arranging for a boat to Bardsey next
morning, we began to think about a
bed, and soon perceived, on reflection,
the total absence of any suitable
accommodation within the limits of
the village. But mark you the excellence
of Welsh hospitality. The
grocer of the place, the man of “the
shop” <em>par excellence</em>, hearing of, or
rather seeing us in a quandary, sent
us his compliments, with a polite request
that we would take up our
quarters under his roof for the night.
This was genuine hospitality; we
hesitated not; and a better turn out
in the way of feeding we have not
often met with. Broiled steaks of
salmon, fresh caught in the adjoining
stream, fowls, and a good slice of
Cheshire cheese, soon set our gastronomic
capabilities at ease. Porter—some
of Guinness’s best—and a
glorious jorum of whisky and water,
moistened our clay, and comforted
our inward man. None of your
wishy-washy whisky, or poor pale
limpid compound, such as you buy
in London; but some of the real
potheen, just arrived from Wicklow—thick,
yellow, oily, and slow to
come out of its narrow-necked bottle.
And then such a bouquet!—none but
a genuine smuggler ever tasted the
like. ’Twas a thing to be tasted, not
described,—the real nectar of the
Druids—if not of the Gods. Being
somewhat fortified by these stout appliances,
and having discussed half-a-dozen
of Pontet’s best Havannahs,
we mounted the rickety stairs that
led through the lofts of our host’s
dwelling to a goodly dormitory at
the further end. And here the worthy
man had really set out for us his
best bed: all the little china and plaster
images were ranged in prime order on
the mantel-piece; and pictures of the
Queen of Sheba and the Prodigal
Son adorned the walls with unfading
brilliancy. The bed looked as clean
as ever we saw a bed in our lives; there
was an odour of lavender about the
room, and we were soon between the
sheets, lost in dreamy oblivion.</p>

<p class='c009'>We awoke: ’twas a lovely morning,
with the earliest sun shining
brightly in through the lattice; and
we thought in our emotion to spring
out of bed. Off went the bed-clothes
at a bound, and we sat erect!—but
how shall we describe our horror?
We had gone to bed more or less
white—more or less European in the
tinge of our skin: we awoke of a glaring
red, or, where the crimson dye
was less vivid, we bore a mottled appearance,
like a speckled toad. And,
as Gulliver once lay among the Lilliputians,
who ran from him, on his
stirring, in frightened thousands, so
there were now our accursed night
visitants scampering away from us in
every direction, possible and impossible,
by thousands—nay, by myriads.
The bed was literally <em>brown</em> with
them; and ever, as we moved a limb,
fresh gangs of latent devourers fled
from beneath, and scoured across the
sheets. They had lost the supernatural
form our dreams had given
them, and assumed the more homely
one of ordinary fleas—of fleas of all
sizes from a pea to a pin’s head! Old
Nereus gave us some relief, for we
rushed into his arms as soon as
doors could be opened, and bolts
forced out of their sockets; but, for
many a long day after, we bore about
us a vivid impression of our visitants
at Aberdaron.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not, therefore, venture to sleep
in a Welsh cottage; nor scarcely in
a farm-house: trust yourself only to
an inn,—your chances of sound
rest and an untenanted bed are at
least more favourable there;—but if
ever you are benighted and forced to
remain away from headquarters,
make up your mind fairly to bivouac
it amid the fern and the heather,
or else sit up at your vigils by your
host’s fire-side. The chirping cricket
and the purring cat shall then be
your sole companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>We might detain you till doomsday
with these “incidents of travel;” but
we shall leave you to make your own
experiments;—yet, ere you venture
into the wilds of Taffyland, peruse
and carry with you for your use and
edification the following:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>The Law of England forms the
most remarkable characteristic of the
country. The Law is the spirit of the
national liberty, the guardian of the
national religion, and the foundation
of the national government. Britain
has the proud distinction of being
almost the only country on earth,
where no act of arbitrary power can
be suffered—where no man’s person,
property, or conscience, can be subjected
to insult with impunity—and
where every man has <em>rights</em>, and all
are alike under the safeguard of Law.</p>

<p class='c009'>We propose to give a rapid sketch
of the history of this great principle
in England.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is singular that the most intellectual
nation of the ancient world—Greece—has
not left us any system
of law. Cicero speaks with professional
scorn of all jurisprudence except
the Roman. He would not have
spoken thus of the Mosaic law, if he
had known it. But one of the most
extraordinary circumstances of the
Hebrew commonwealth, is the general
ignorance of its incomparable institutions,
which prevailed among the
most active inquirers of the northern
world. But law existed from the
earliest periods in Greece, though its
name was often and curiously changed.
In the time of Homer, the name
of law was <em>Themis</em>, or establishment.
In the time of Hesiod, the name was
<em>Nomos</em>, or distribution. In after
times, it was <em>Dikè</em>, or justice. The
cause of the Greek want of system was
said to be the <em>number</em> of judges in
their courts, which rendered the decision
rather matter of popular sentiment
than of fixed rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>The systematic nature of the Roman
law arose from there being in general
but <em>one</em> judge in each court. The
two prætors—the one for the city,
and the other for the external jurisdiction—were
annually appointed,
and were accustomed, on entering on
their offices, to state the rules on
which they intended to act. Those
rules became gradually embodied, and
finally formed the groundwork of the
Roman law.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the language of Rome, Law was
<i><span lang="la">Lex</span></i>, from <em>Lego</em>, as the proposal of the
rule was <em>read</em> by the magistrate to
the assembly of the people. The
Anglo-Saxon name was Laga, from
<i><span lang="ang">Legen</span></i>, to lay down—from which
comes our word Law.</p>

<p class='c009'>Law in England ascends as high
as the time of the Druids, who, however,
had no written code. But they
seem to have left us the custom of
Gavelkind—the division of the property
of an intestate between the
widow and the children, and the
burning of a widow found guilty of
her husband’s murder.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Roman, Pictish, and Saxon
invasions, with the Heptarchy, filled
the country with a general confusion
of laws, until the time of Alfred.
This great king and man of genius
undertook to remodel the whole constitution
of the West-Saxon monarchy—a
design, for whose execution
he has been praised by all the philosophic
lawyers, as exhibiting the
highest sagacity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principle of his reform was, to
make every man answerable to an
immediate superior for his personal
conduct, and that of his neighbourhood.
For this purpose, England
was divided into tithings and hundreds,
and perhaps into counties, all
being under a supreme magistrate—the
king. He also collected into a
volume all the customs of the various
districts, which he issued for the
guidance of the several country courts.
Those in their turn were liable to
account to the king’s courts, which
were kept in the royal household, and
which travelled with this great king,
whose life seems to have been chiefly
occupied in traversing the kingdom as
high minister of law, and teaching its
principles to his people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Danish invasions shook this
code, but had not the power to crush
it. It was renewed by King Edgar,
a man of vigour and talents. The
digest was completed by his grandson,
Edward the Confessor—the
whole forming the common law, or
law <em>common</em> to the whole realm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principles of the Saxon law,
which were the principles of their
fathers in the German forests, and
were the principles of truth and nature,
were briefly these:—The establishment
of the Wittena-gemote, or
assembly of wise men—a species of
parliament, without which no new
law could be made, or old one
changed; the election of all magistrates
by the people; the hereditary
descent of the crown; the commutation
of capital punishments, on the
first offence, for a fine; military service
in proportion to land; forfeiture
of land for treason, but <em>not</em> corruption
of blood; the descent of lands to all
the male’s equally, without right of
primogeniture, (a rule unworthy of
Saxon wisdom;) the use of county
courts in ordinary cases, with courts
held before the king in the higher;
last, and most important of all, trial
by jury (though trial was also held by
ordeal.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Of those principles, some were
evidently unfit for subsequent civilisation;
and some refined themselves.
But the whole system, when compared
with the old Roman code, and with
many of the codes of Europe which
followed it, exhibits an extraordinary
evidence of the manliness of feeling,
and justness of conception, existing
among the Saxon ancestry of England.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the eleventh century, the Norman
Conquest burst in upon the
country with the force of an inundation,
and swept before it throne,
liberty, and <em>laws</em>. The influence of
Rome now began to act powerfully
on the people. Ecclesiastical courts
were formed, separate from the civil,
and the Romish priesthood were
gradually exempted from the secular
power.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another formidable innovation was
in the “royal forests.” The Norman
kings were “mighty hunters,” and
whole counties were stripped of their
population, to give room for beasts
of chase. They transplanted the
forest laws of the Continent into
England, and the penalties of their
game laws were terrible. In the
Saxon times, though no man was
allowed “to kill the king’s deer,”
yet every man was allowed to kill the
game on his own estate. But the
Norman law made the king the
proprietor of <em>all game</em>, and no man
could kill bird of the air, or beast
of the field, without express royal
license, by a grant of <em>free-warren</em>,
which was more for the purpose of
preserving the game than giving a
right to the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>With one exception, the Norman
invasion was an unequivocal calamity.
That exception was the right of primogeniture—a
right essential to the
establishment of a nobility, to the
permanence of families in a condition
of honour, and to the prevention of a
gradual pauperism and degradation of
society, as the lands became divided
more and more. In all others, it was
a sudden and mischievous extinction
of all popular rights, and of all the
principles of national progress. It
made law arbitrary by curtailing the
power of the county courts, and
giving it to the king’s Norman
justiciers, who thus became masters
of every thing, and, by their Norman
subtleties, altogether confused the
national law. It introduced the
feudal law, which was tyrannical in
its essence. It almost excluded the
national language from all public use,
Norman-French alone being used in
all the courts. It introduced the trial
by combat, the origin of that custom
which, under the name of duelling,
authorises murder, provided the
murdered man has previously had
formal notice that his murder was
intended; and also, that he had a
chance of adding the murder of his
adversary to his own. And to this
Norman tyranny was due the whole
long series of ruinous wars, which
involved both England and France
in infinite wretchedness, for little less
than a hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Saxon law continued in this
state of humiliation until the reign
of John, with slight occasional advances
towards freedom. But, in
this reign, the severity of the forest
laws roused the barons into insurrection,
and the King was forced to sign
the two famous regulations, the Forest
Charter, and the Great Charter. The
former diminished some of the cruelties
of the forest law, and the latter
laid the foundations of the Constitution,
by restoring the general principles
of the Saxon law. It protected
the subject from the severity of
royal fines and royal loans, and considerably
narrowed the wasteful expenditure
of the throne. In private
rights, it established the testamentary
power of the husband over part of
his estates, and the law of dowery.
In public police, it established a uniformity
of weights and measures, gave
protection to commercial strangers,
and forbade the alienation of lands by
mortmain. In matters of public justice,
it forbade all denials and delays
of justice, established the court of
Common Pleas at Westminster, to
relieve the suitor from following the
courts round the country; directed
assizes and annual circuits to be
held, and appointed inquests. It
established the liberties of London,
and of all the cities, towns, and ports
of England. And finally, and by its
noblest act of power, it declared the
protection of every man in his life,
liberty, and property, unless convicted
by the judgment of his peers,
or the law of the land. This was
perhaps the noblest document ever
published by a people, and well deserves
its name of <span class='sc'>Magna Charta</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Popish controversy of our
day, the existence of Magna Charta
has been adduced as a proof of the
freedom encouraged under Popery.
But it is forgotten that the whole
proceeding was instantly denounced
by the Pope, and laid under anathema.
It was a recurrence to the laws of
their Saxon ancestors, demanded by
the severe necessities of the time, and
originating in impulses of human
nature too strong for the bondage of
the national superstition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The glorious Reformation in the
sixteenth century produced a hidden
and powerful change in the aspect of
English law. The Papal supremacy
fell, and relieved the law of a most
intolerable obstruction. The crown
became the true head of the government.
Man no longer gave a divided
allegiance to an English monarch and
an Italian monk; and the appointment
of the bishops was thenceforth
taken from foreign hands, and invested
in the sovereign of the realm. Freedom
now began to make palpable
progress; for although the prerogative
was still unabated, and was often
tyrannical in the reigns of Henry,
Mary, and Elizabeth, there was a
growing tendency to its abatement;
and its use by Elizabeth was in
general so lenient, as to be scarcely
perceptible.</p>

<p class='c009'>A general change in English society
also powerfully co-operated with this
progress. Peace had brought commerce,
and commerce wealth to the
merchant: the lower orders, of course,
shared in the general prosperity, and
their condition became more important
in the national eyes, and in their
own. The nobles, disdaining commerce,
became unable to compete
with the new generation of opulence,
and dissipated their estates, which
fell into the hands of the citizens.
On the other hand, the throne, enriched
by the confiscation of the monasteries,
became hourly more independent of
the barons; and the contest for power
was evidently to be thenceforth determined
between the throne and the
people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The glories of Elizabeth, her services
to religion, and her gentle
exercise of the sceptre, had reconciled
the nation to the prerogative. But
the accession of James awoke the
nation: his manners were offensive,
his habits were unmanly, he wanted
the dignity of Elizabeth on the throne,
and he wanted the spirit of her
government among the people. His
death left a legacy of revolution. His
son had been intended by nature for
private life, but he was marked by
misfortune to be a king. Brave
without fortitude, and graceful without
sincerity, he would have made an
incomparable figure in his own court,
if he had not been encumbered with
the high duties of a throne. Charles
was destined to be undone, from the
time when he began to revive the
obsolete statutes of the forest law,
sustain the severities of the Star
Chamber and High Commission courts,
and raise arbitrary taxes in the shape
of tonnage and poundage. The disuse
of parliaments alienated from him
every lover of liberty. Hampden, a
name deserving of all honour in the
history of freedom, struck the first
blow at the new fabric of tyranny, by
his resistance to ship-money. The
King himself hurried on his ruin, by
concessions as precipitate as his
demands had been unjustifiable; and
this most melancholy of all struggles
ended in the most melancholy
of all consummations—a military
tyranny.</p>

<p class='c009'>The restoration of the Stuarts gave
us the Habeas Corpus Act—an illustrious
memorial of national good
sense, and of national security.
Magna Charta had gone no further
than to forbid imprisonment, contrary
to law. The Habeas Corpus gave
the man power to release himself, and
punish his injurers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The glorious Revolution of 1688
gave another impulse to the whole
system of English liberty. It pronounced
the authority of law to be
supreme. It gave us the Bill of
Rights, the Toleration Act, and the
Act of Settlement. It justified the
doctrine of necessary resistance; it
regulated trials for high treason; it
modelled the Civil List; it made the
administration of the income accountable
to parliament; and constituted
the judges independent of the throne.</p>

<p class='c009'>The constitution was now complete,
or if not, all the improvements still
necessary to make it such, were prepared
in the nature of the noble plan
which was thus laid down by the
nation. The changes which have since
occurred in the general law have been
scarcely more than attempts to simplify
its proceedings. The changes
in parliamentary law have been more
perilous, through the Reform Bill of
1831 following the Popish Bill of
1829. The change in international
law has been marked by a feature
whose peril seems too imminent, yet
whose practical effect is still to be ascertained,—the
establishment of direct
diplomatic intercourse with the Popedom.
Protestantism is justly alarmed
at this sudden abandonment of one of
the fundamental principles of 1688;
at the direct encouragement which it
must give to all the demands of
Popery in England; at the triumph
which, for the first time in two centuries,
it gives to the factious spirit
of Popery; at the aid which it may
give to its superstition; and at the
national hazards which may be involved
in the rash attempt to subdue
Irish violence by Papal instrumentality,
and even at the political perils
which may result from the authorised
presence of a Popish Italian at the
court of a Protestant sovereign. The
palliatives of the measure are certainly
trifling. The ambassador is
not to be an ecclesiastic, and the
Pope is not to be called the “sovereign
pontiff.” But a Jesuit may
be the same in a plain coat and in a
red hat, and the Pope is the <em>master</em> of
the Papist, call him by what name we
will. Such is statesmanship in the
nineteenth century!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Lord Chancellor Hardwicke
was the son of a country attorney,
who was probably a respectable man——for
he was needy, though the town-clerk,
and seems to have had some
friends, though in the profession of
the law. The biographer labours
hard to prove that he had ancestors—a
matter which may be conceded to all
men—and that, if some of them were
poor, some were rich; a point perfectly
within the possibilities of human
things. He contends further, that a
<em>branch</em> of the name of Yorke had held
the mayoralty of Calais in the fifteenth
century. But as he gives us no
knowledge of the <em>distance</em> of that
branch from the trunk, and as all
have had kings as well as beggars
among their progenitors, being the
common descendants of Adam, there
is not much use in those discoveries,
and not the slightest balm to the hurt
pride of the Hardwickes; for the whole
dwindles down to the distressful but
common conclusion, that in the seventeenth
century the family were on
the decline, and all their honours
were diminished into the humility of a
provincial solicitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we come to wiser information.
The first mention of the future chancellor
is in the following document in
his personal journal:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Philip Yorke, born at Dover the
1st day of December 1690, and baptised
on Thursday 9th of December.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The learned biographer wastes some
more of his paragraphs in proving
“that poverty is no disgrace;” but
it must be acknowledged that it is
neither comfort nor credit, and that
it would have done no harm whatever
to the attorney, if he had been in possession
of a clear thousand a-year.</p>

<p class='c009'>His son Philip was naturally intended
to follow his own profession,
and about his sixteenth year was sent
to learn it in the office of a solicitor
of the name of Salkeld, brother of the
celebrated sergeant. It was a rather
curious circumstance, that of the young
men then in Salkeld’s office, there
were two future Lord Chancellors, a
Master of the Rolls, and a future Lord
Chief Baron: Jocelyn, subsequently
Chancellor of Ireland; Strange, Master
of the Rolls; Parker, Chief of the
Exchequer; and Yorke, who was
destined to act as high a part in administration
as in law.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are some slight suspicions
that young Yorke had been <em>articled</em>
to Salkeld, and a <em>clerk</em> to his brother
the sergeant. But against these <em>imputations</em>
the biographer battles with
a desperate fidelity. It is a pity to
see so much zeal thrown away;
for the Great Chancellor, as he was
deservedly called, would not have
been an atom the less great if he had
been <em>articled</em> to the one brother and
<em>clerk</em> to the other. He might have
been only the more entitled to praise
for the eminence to which he rose.
We respect the aristocracy so far as
it ought to be respected; but we are
not at all inclined to look for the
pedigree of talents in the dusty records
of a worn-out genealogy, or feel
that the slightest degree of additional
honour attaches to learning and integrity,
by the best blazonry of the
Herald’s Office.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young student must have soon
given evidence of his capacity; for
Salkeld, a man sagacious in his estimate
of his pupils, recommended that
he should try the larger branch of
the profession, and put his name on
the books of the Temple, which was
done Nov. 29, 1708. We have then
a dissertation on the propriety of
keeping Terms by dining in the hall
of the Temple. This, too, is so much
wisdom thrown away. A good dinner
is, under all circumstances, a good
thing. It requires as little apology
as any conceivable act of human existence.
In the hall, the young barrister
is at least in the company of
gentlemen, which he perhaps would
not be, but for that contingency; if
he does not learn much law, he at
least learns something of life; and if
he has a spark of ambition in his
frame, it may be blown into a flame
by the sight of so many portly Chief
Justices, and Lord Chief Barons,
with an occasional glimpse of a retired
Lord Chancellor, reposing on a sinecure
of £5000 a-year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another weakness of the biographer
is an eloquent effort to <em>prove</em> that a
barrister, whose talents raise him to
the summit of his profession, is but
little the worse for the want of a
university education. It would have
been quite sufficient to say, that
Philip Yorke rose to be the first
lawyer of his age, and Lord Chancellor,
without having ever set foot within
the walls of a college.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yorke, at the commencement of
his career, was fortunate in an introduction
through Parker, one of his
fellow-students at Salkeld’s, to Lord
Macclesfield, Lord Chief Justice, to
whose son it is said that he was engaged
as law-tutor. The Chief Justice
received him at his table, took an
evident interest in his progress, and
patronised him on every important
occasion. Yorke’s manners were as
gentle as his intellect was acute; and
such a man would naturally be received
with favour at the table of a
person so high in rank as Lord
Macclesfield. But it has never been
said that he humiliated himself for
that honour; and through life he had
a quiet way of gaining his point, of
which a curious instance was given in
his earliest days.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wife of Salkeld was a thrifty
personage, who, evidently thinking
that her husband’s pupils might be
employed in other operations than
scribbling parchments, occasionally
sent him on her messages, and even
to execute some of her commissions
in Covent Garden Market. Yorke
obeyed, but on giving in the account
of his expenditure on those occasions,
there appeared frequent entries of
coach hire, for “celery and turnips
from Covent Garden,” a “barrel of
oysters from the fishmonger’s,” &#38;c.
&#38;c. Salkeld, perceiving this, remarked
to his wife on the expensive
nature of this “saving,” and Yorke
was no longer employed as her conveyancer
of celery and turnips.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had also some pleasantry as
well as point, of which an anecdote
was told by the late Jeremy Bentham.
Powis, one of the judges of the King’s
Bench, one day at a lawyers’ dinner
expressed to Yorke his “surprise” at
his having got into so much business
in so short a period. “I conceive,”
said the old fool, “that you must
have published some book, or be
about publishing something; for look,
d’ye see? (which seems to have been a
favourite phrase of his,) there is
scarcely a cause before the court but
you are employed in it.” Yorke
answered with a smile, “that he had
indeed some thoughts of publishing,
but that he had yet made no progress
in his book. Powis, priding himself
on his sagacity, begged to know its
nature. He was answered that it
was a “Versification of Coke upon
Littleton.” The judge begged a
specimen, on which Yorke recited—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He that holdeth his lands in fee</div>
      <div class='line'>Need neither to quake nor to shiver,</div>
      <div class='line'>I humbly conceive; for <em>look, do you see</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>They are his and his heirs for ever.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It may fairly be presumed that a
laugh went round the table; but
Powis was so fully convinced that he
had hit upon the true reason, that on
meeting Yorke some months after, he
inquired gravely about the progress
of his volume.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, Powis seems to have
been a mark for the wits, as we find
by some lines on the Bench, by the
memorable Duke of Wharton:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c009'>Yorke was now beginning to feel
his way in his profession; and if
poverty had been his original stimulus,
he had a fair prospect of exchanging
it for wealth. The <em>dictum</em> of
Thurlow on this subject is proverbial.
When asked by some friend to advise
his son as to “the way he should go”
to rise at the bar, that rough functionary
said, “Let him spend all his
fortune—then marry, and spend his
wife’s fortune; and then let him return
to his books, and <em>he may</em> have
some chance of business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Yorke, without spending either
his or his wife’s fortune, had already
taken the first step to official distinction
by entering Parliament, May
2, 1719. He was chosen member for
Lewes in Sussex. The simplicity of
this transaction affords a curious contrast
to the performances of the present
day. The Duke of Newcastle
sent a letter to the “free and independent
electors,” evidently directing
them to elect his friend Mr Yorke.
The letter was duly answered by an
address from one hundred and thirty-two
electors, in this style:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“We, whose names are hereunto
subscribed, the constables and inhabitants
of the borough of Lewes, having
heard your Grace’s letter publicly
read, do not only herein return your
Grace our hearty thanks for the
<em>honour</em> you have done us in recommending
so fit a person as Mr Yorke,
to serve as one of our representatives
in parliament for this town, for
the present vacancy, but also beg
leave to assure your Grace, that we
do unanimously and entirely approve
of him, and shall be ready <em>on all occasions</em>
to show the regard we have
to the favour your Grace has pleased
to lay upon us.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your Grace’s most obliged and</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“Obedient humble servants.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The orthography of those honest
people differs from modern penmanship,—but
the <em>principle</em> of the affair,
even in our polished day of liberalism,
probably differs no more than a close
borough of the year 1719 differs from
an open borough of 1848. The successful
barrister, and promising member
of parliament, now made the most
important step which any man can
make, and took to himself a wife.
It would be unfair to say that in this
instance he was guided by the calculations
which are so often charged
upon his profession. But there can
be no doubt, that whatever might be
the pleasure of his new connexion, it
had all the merit of prudence. The
lady was a widow, young and pretty,
and with a fortune of £6000, which
at that time was probably equal to
twice the sum in our day. But probably
a charm of no inferior importance
was her being the niece of Sir
Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls.
The whole transaction was sufficiently
juridical. Sir Joseph had sent
a letter with Yorke, to be presented
to Mr Charles Cox, the father of the
lady, who had married Mary, the
eldest daughter of Lord Somers. On
reading the letter, the old gentleman
desired Yorke to “leave his rental
and writings” with him; and upon
Yorke’s acknowledging that he had
neither, Cox expressed his astonishment
that his brother-in-law, Sir
Joseph, “should have recommended
such a person to him.” On writing
to Sir Joseph on the subject, he received
an answer, “not to hesitate a
moment in accepting the offer, for
that the gentleman who made it, and
was now content with his daughter’s
£6000, would in another year expect
<em>three or four times the sum with a wife</em>!”
The letter had its effect, and the marriage
took place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yorke then took a house in Lincoln’s
Inn Fields, and began to go
circuit; there his biographer stoutly
and justly defends him against the
imputation of “intriguing for business,”
alleged in Lord Campbell’s
“Lives of the Chancellors;” an imputation
which has not been sustained
by any part of his subsequent conduct.
For, though charged with
singular anxiety to realise a fortune,
there is no evidence of any meanness
in its pursuit. And his professional
distinction, his natural talent,
and his rank as a member of parliament,
(a matter of high consideration
in those days) rendered his possession
of business natural and easy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he was soon to have official
distinction. When going the Western
Circuit, he received a letter from the
Lord Chancellor, announcing to him
“his Majesty’s pleasure to select
him for Solicitor General;” an office
into which he was sworn in March
1720, at the age of thirty!</p>

<p class='c009'>Much professional dissatisfaction
was exhibited on this promotion of
so young a member of the bar; and
for some period the attorneys exhibited
an equal reluctance to employ
him in important causes. But, as a
leader, he soon showed qualities which
had been partially concealed in his inferior
rank, and reconciled at once the
public and the profession to his precedency.
It has been remarked, that
some of the most distinguished judges
have <em>not</em> been successful in the lower
rank of their profession, while it has
not rarely happened that the most
distinguished advocates have failed as
judges. The qualifications for the
bench, and those for the bar, or even
for the leadership of the bar, have considerable
differences, and the management
of the great principles of
law is evidently a separate task from
the dexterity of detail.</p>

<p class='c009'>The father of the Solicitor General,
who had the happiness to see his
son’s promotion, died in the following
year. It appears that Yorke,
who was now Sir Philip, kept up a
constant and kind correspondence
with his family, which was, of course,
strengthened by his having obtained
the recordership of Dover, an appointment
which he valued very highly,
and retained through life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The volume contains some striking
remarks on the often discussed question—“why
lawyers seldom succeed
as parliamentary speakers.” And
the reason assigned, and truly assigned,
is, that lawyers have something
else to do. The man who is
occupied all day in the courts, has no
time for parliamentary subjects. He
comes into the House fatigued, and
unsupplied with the detail which is
<em>necessary</em> to give effect to any address
in so business-like an assembly. He
merely gives an opinion and sits
down. If he attempts more, he generally
fails; or his best success is an
escape. Thus the two greatest advocates
whom England and Ireland
have ever seen, Erskine and Curran,
were ineffective in parliament—the
only distinction being, that Erskine
was laughed at, while Curran was
laughed with. With these extraordinary
men, who had every quality
of the orator, and whose vigour of
argument took the bench by storm,
while the flashes of their imagination
threw brilliancy over the dreariest
topics, there could be no conceivable
source of failure, except in their want
of preparation for the peculiar objects
of debate.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there is also another, and an
obvious consideration. There are but
few orators in the world, and these
few are not always either lawyers or
members of parliament. But, when
the true orator appears, he is <em>felt</em>,
and he would be felt in an assembly
of Esquimaux. He requires no complacency
in his audience; he communicates
with their spirit, at once.
He touches strings which, however
unawakened before, are in every living
bosom; he finds echoes in the
heart, which a thousand other voices
might have called on in vain.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time it must be admitted,
that the knowledge which law
demands, is of high importance to any
success which hopes to be <em>permanent</em>
in the House; that its nature in the
questions constantly coming before
an assembly of lawmakers, is indisputable;
and that the perfection of a
debater would consist in his possessing
the knowledge of a lawyer, combined
with the taste, talent, and
expansive views of a statesman. The
lawyers in parliament have always
possessed great weight; and though
the instances of their arriving at the
Premiership are <em>remarkably</em> few, (we
recollect but one, the late Mr Perceval,)
they have always possessed a
large share of parliamentary power.</p>

<p class='c009'>A case of some peculiarity occurred
at this time—it was the proposal to
commute the sentence of death on
some criminals, on condition of their
submitting to inoculation for the
small-pox. The case was laid before
Raymond and Yorke, the Attorney
and Solicitor General; whose answer
was in this form;</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lives of those persons being
in the power of his majesty, he may
grant a pardon to them on such lawful
condition as he may think fit.
And, as to this particular condition,
we have no objection in point of law;
the rather, because the carrying on
this practice to perfection, may lead
to the general benefit of mankind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The small-pox was then almost a
plague: it assailed all classes; and
some of the royal children, and many
of those of the nobility died of it. Its
extraordinary power of disfiguring
the features of the survivors made it
scarcely less dreaded than its mortality.
In tropical climates it swept
off the population by thousands.
Mankind, in our age, cannot be too
grateful to the good fortune, or rather
to that interposition of providence,
which, by giving us the discovery of
Vaccination, has at length comparatively
freed the world from this most
afflicting and most fatal disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Yorke was soon called on to
perform other and more difficult duties
than those of humanity. The influence
of the exiled Stuarts was still
powerful. Superstition and self-interest
had sustained a close connexion
in Great Britain. The manners of
the Brunswick line had their share in
sustaining this influence. They were
singularly unpopular. The first
George was coarse in manners, and
vulgar in mind. All about him, even
to his follies, was imported from
Hanover; and he was never able to
discover the distinction between an
empire and an electorate. The second
George was a man of ability; but
while he was superior to the habits
of his predecessor, he had equally
repulsive habits of his own. The
king was at once subtle and uncouth,
artificial in his designs, yet rude in
their execution; clear-headed in his
views, yet confused in his government.
Germanism clung to him, to
the last. He, too, could not discover
the distinction between the throne of
the first country of Europe, and the
sovereignty of a German province.
The private history of his court, also,
was the reverse of flattering to the
morals of his country; and the public
feeling often rebuked them with singular
vigour of tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other hand, the misfortunes
of the Stuarts, though most amply
deserved, had thrown a tinge of
romance over their fate; and even
their insults to its freedom in religion
and constitution were partially forgotten.
The chivalric character of
the Prince threw an additional
interest on his story; and the contrast
between a gallant young man, determined
to struggle for the throne of
his forefathers, and the crafty and
egoistical character of the king, offered
strong probabilities for the success of
an enterprise worthy of a competitor
for the crown of England.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 12th of May 1722, an announcement
appeared in the newspapers,
stating that the “Lord Mayor
of London had received a letter from
Lord Townshend, one of his Majesty’s
principal Secretaries of State, informing
him, that the king had received
intelligence of a conspiracy, in concert
with traitors abroad, to raise a rebellion
in favour of the Pretender.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A few days before, a proclamation
had appeared, offering a reward of
£500 for the apprehension of one
Weston, formerly clerk to Gray’s Inn
Chapel. Warrants were immediately
issued for the apprehension of many
other persons, of whom the principal
was Atterbury, the Bishop of Rochester,
who was arrested at his deanery
in Westminster, carried before the
Council, and committed to the Tower.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shortly after, Lords North and
Grey were arrested in the Isle of
Wight; and about the same time the
principal agent, one Layer, a barrister,
was also seized. North was
committed to the Tower, where, on
his lady’s desiring admission to him,
and being refused, he exhibited a
specimen of that pleasantry which
seems to have belonged to the name.
Opening his window, “Madam,”
said he, “this is a <em>convent</em> for men,
and not for your sex.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Layer’s trial soon followed. The
evidence proved that he had been
engaged in a plan for a general insurrection,
for the overthrow of the established
government, and for bringing
in the Chevalier. The king, the
prince, and the ministers, were to be
seized, the Tower was to be taken,
and the army was to be bought over.
The correspondence on this subject
had been seized at Layer’s chambers,
in Southampton Buildings, and was
in his handwriting.</p>

<p class='c009'>An instance of what may be regarded
as the etiquette of English
law, was given on his trial. The
prisoner had been carried to the court
at Westminster in fetters, of which
he complained to the Chief Justice as
an insult. To this it was replied, that
he had made an attempt to escape;
on which the judge said, that the
use of the fetters was justifiable. But,
on his being brought into court, his
counsel applied to have the fetters
taken off; to which the judge replied,
“The irons <em>must</em> be taken off: we
shall not stir until the irons are taken
off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Solicitor General spoke with
great effect in reply to the prisoner’s
counsel, and Layer was found guilty.
He was several times reprieved, in
the hope of obtaining evidence sufficient
to implicate persons of higher
rank, who were strongly suspected,
Layer being evidently but an agent.
However, he was at length executed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A bill of pains and penalties was
then brought in against the Bishop of
Rochester. Among the witnesses in
his favour was the celebrated Alexander
Pope, who came forward to depose
to the Bishop’s domestic habits and
studies. But it was remarked, that
his performance on this occasion only
showed that his abilities were not
formed for exhibition in a court of
justice. He made but an indifferent
figure as a witness: he had but little
to say, and that little he blundered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Atterbury himself, however, made
a better display. It having been
insinuated that Sir Robert Walpole
had tampered with the Bishop’s witnesses,
for the purpose of involving
other persons of condition, Walpole
appeared in person to disavow the
charge. Atterbury fastened on him,
and exerted all his dexterity to make
him contradict himself. “A greater
trial of skill,” observed Speaker Onslow,
“than this scarcely ever happened
between two such combatants,—the
one fighting for his reputation,
the other for his acquittal.” The bill
of pains and penalties was brought in
by eighty-seven peers to forty-three.
Atterbury was banished; and the
following paragraph in one of the
journals gives the account of his
departure:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“June 19, 1723.—Yesterday, between
twelve and one, the deprived
Bishop of Rochester set out from the
Tower in the navy barge, and was
delivered up to Captain Laurence,
commander of the Aldborough man-of-war,
lying in Long Reach. Two
footmen in purple liveries attended
him, himself being in a lay habit of
gray cloth. Great numbers of people
went to see him take water, many of
whom accompanied him down the
river in barges and boats. We hear
that two messengers went on board
the man-of-war, to see him set on
shore at Ostend, whence, it is said,
he will proceed to Aix-la-Chapelle,
after staying some time at Brussels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bishop, however, was set on
shore at Calais, from the violence of
the weather, which made the passage
to Ostend dangerous; and on being
told at landing, that Bolingbroke had
received the king’s pardon, and had
arrived at the same place on his
return to England, he pleasantly said,
“Then I am <em>exchanged</em>.” Pope observed
that “the nation was afraid
of being overrun with too much
politeness, and could not gain one
great genius, but at the expense of
another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That Bolingbroke was a man of
remarkable talent, must be believed
from the evidence of his public career.
But the fame of Atterbury seems to
have had no firmer foundations than
his being the intimate of Pope, and
a Jacobite. He had the scholarship
of an academic, but he gave no
exhibition of ability in public life.
His sermons are extant, and are
trifling. As a Jacobite, he must have
been incapable of comprehending the
value of liberty, regardless of Protestantism,
and faithless to his king.
His mitre alone probably saved him
from a severer punishment than exile.
But the simple fact that a Protestant
bishop conspired to bring back a
dynasty pledged to Popery, and notorious
for persecution, is enough to
consign his memory to historic shame.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another curious instance, involving
a bishop, occurred about this period.
Wilson, the Bishop of Sodor and
Man, in consequence of his refusal of
the holy sacrament to the wife
of the governor of the island, was
thrown by him into prison, and
fined. The bishop appealed to the
Privy Council, by whom he was
released, on the opinion of the Attorney
and Solicitor Generals, and the
fine was remitted. The Earl of Derby,
the “sovereign” of the island, contended
that it was a “free nation.”
But he was not able to show that its
freedom implied the power of controlling
the spiritual functions of the bishop.</p>

<p class='c009'>On this subject, however, it must be
acknowledged that the right of refusing
the sacrament to individuals who might
be disapproved of by the clergy, was
obviously dangerous, and, though retained
in words, is justly abandoned
in practice by the Establishment.
Such a practice would imply that the
clergyman could penetrate the secrets
of the heart: it would also give a
most offensive power of public insult,
a strong temptation to private revenge,
and might inflict an irreparable
injury on personal character, without
any public trial, or any means of personal
defence. It is also observable,
that no man <em>can</em> ascertain how suddenly
and effectually conversion may
change the whole tenor of the mind;
while the mere fact of coming to the
communion-table naturally implies a
returning sense of duty. Some of the
half Popish disciplinarians of our day,
who talk much more of the church
than they think of Christianity, have
attempted to renew this harsh and
hazardous practice. But the man of
sense will avoid the insult; and the
Christian will acknowledge that, if
rebuke is to be administered at all, it
ought to be in the shape of private
exhortation, and not in the arbitrary
and exasperating form of public
shame.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most painful part in the office
of Attorney General is the duty of
prosecuting high criminals. The Earl
of Macclesfield now put this duty to
the test. A charge was laid against
the Chancellor for corruption in the
sale of masterships in Chancery, and
the embezzlement of the suitors’
money in their hands. He was impeached
by the Commons, and tried
by the Lords, was found guilty, and
fined £30,000. But on the questions
being put that he should be rendered
incapable of serving the king, or
sitting in parliament, both were negatived;
but, for the honour of parliament,
the one only by forty-two to
forty-two, the Speaker giving, of
course, the vote in his favour; and
the latter by forty-five to thirty-nine.
The trial lasted twenty days, and
naturally excited great attention.
The ground of his escape from official
ruin, (for nothing could save him
from public shame,) was probably his
favouritism at St James’s—a favouritism
which, unluckily for the honour
of the courtiers, seems to have remained
undiminished.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conduct of the Attorney General
has been censured, as ungrateful
to his early patron; but the censure
is unfounded. He did all that he
could: he refused to join in the prosecution,
and avoided this duty with
some difficulty. The Earl’s guilt was
notorious; nothing could save him.
It was no part of the Attorney General’s
virtues to thwart public justice,
nor was it in his power. He simply
consulted the delicacy of old friendship,
by refusing to urge its progress.
It has been even asked, Why did he
not <em>resign</em>? Such is the absurdity of
querists. His resignation could not
have saved the Chancellor, who, after
all, escaped with the easy sacrifice of
a comparatively small sum from a
purse believed to be plethoric with
the public money.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yorke still continued to advance in
reputation and office. The deaths of
the Chancellor and the Chief Justice
were followed by the appointment of
Talbot to the woolsack, and of Yorke
to the Chief Justiceship, with an increase
of the salary from £2000 to
£4000 a-year, and the peerage, by
the title of Baron Hardwicke, from
an estate which he had purchased in
the county of Gloucester.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was now on the verge of his
highest promotion. The Chancellor
Talbot died in February 1736, after
five days’ illness, at the age of fifty-three.</p>

<p class='c009'>An entry in Lord Hardwicke’s
private journal gives a curious and
characteristic account of his promotion.
“On Monday the 14th of
February, about five in the morning,
died Charles Talbot, Lord High
Chancellor of Great Britain. The
<em>same forenoon</em>, being at the sittings
in Westminster Hall, I received a
letter from Sir Robert Walpole, desiring
to speak with me on the event
of that morning, and wishing that I
would dine with him that day in
private. I went accordingly, and after
dinner he proposed the Great Seal to
me in the king’s name. Thereupon I
took occasion to state to him, that I
was now in a quiet situation, which,
by practice, was become easy to me;
that I had no <em>ambition</em> to go higher;
and, though I had the most grateful
sense of his majesty’s goodness, desired
to be left where I was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir Robert perfectly understood
this “nolo episcopari” style, and
pressed the appointment. We are a
little ashamed for the delicacy of the
future Chancellor; for he now told
the minister, that the Chief Clerkship
of the King’s Bench being likely to
fall soon into his gift, which he might
grant for two lives for the benefit of
his family, he must have an equivalent!
After some bargaining, Yorke
offered to take the reversion of the
Tellership of the Exchequer for his
eldest son. Walpole objected, that
the king “disliked reversions.” And
well he might; for the Tellership of
the Exchequer was said to have
amounted (in subsequent times) to
£40,000 a-year! The bargain was
at length struck—the Tellership was
given, and Hardwicke was Chancellor.
A note in Horace Walpole’s
Memoirs adds point to the transaction:
it says that “Walpole, finding
it difficult to make Hardwicke give
up the Chief Justiceship, told him
that, if he refused, he would give the
Seals to Fazakerly. ‘What!’ exclaimed
Hardwicke, ‘Fazakerly! he
is a Tory, perhaps a Jacobite.’ ‘All
very true,’ replied Walpole; ‘but if
by one o’clock you do not accept my
offer, Fazakerly, <em>by two</em>, becomes
Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and
one of <em>the stanchest Whigs in England</em>!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chancellor, as a scholar and a
man of the world, was consulted by
his friends on occasional rules of life;
and, in answer to a request of the
Marchioness of Annandale to give his
opinion on the course of education
proper for her son, Hardwicke, in giving
a detail of the studies proper for a
nobleman, as classics, mathematics,
law, &#38;c., alludes to foreign travel.</p>

<p class='c009'>He observes “that, in former
times, the people of Britain were
observed to return home with their
affections more strongly engaged towards
the well-tempered constitution
and liberty of their own country,
from having observed the misery
resulting from the military governments
abroad. But, by an unlucky
reverse, it (now) sometimes happens
that, from being taught to like the
fashions and manners of foreign countries,
people are led to have no
aversion to their political institutions,
and their methods of exercising civil
power.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He then adverts to the still more
serious evil which our own generation
feel every day:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Protestant religion being
established here, is one great security,
not only of our religious, but also of
our civil liberty. That ocular demonstration
of the gross superstitions
and absurdities of Popery which travelling
furnishes, was formerly thought
to fix the mind in a more firm attachment
to the former, and abhorrence
of the latter.” He then adverts to the
culpable change frequently wrought
by foreign life on this wise and salutary
feeling. “I fear the case is now
somewhat otherwise; with this further
ill consequence, that many of our
young men, by a long interruption of
the exercise of their own religion,
become absolutely indifferent to all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The truth of the case, however, is,
that travelling is <em>not</em> the source of the
injury done to the habits and principles
of the English: it is <em>residence</em>
abroad that does the irreparable mischief.
Travelling enlarges the mind;
residence abroad narrows, degrades,
and vitiates it. No Englishman who
has long resided in a foreign city,
(except, perhaps, in a university, for
the pursuit of learning,) is ever fit
for any thing when he returns: he
is a practical idler, and pitiful
lounger round coffee-houses and gaming-tables.
He discovers that his
“feelings are too refined” for the
roughness of English life—that his
frame is “too delicate for anything
but a southern climate”—boasts of
his sensibilities, while he is leading a
life of the most vulgar and gross
vice—until, beggared by debauchery,
or worn out with disease, he drops
into the tomb, without leaving a
regret or a manly recollection behind
him. For all the higher purposes of
life he had long been ruined—without
country, without public spirit, without
a sense of duty, he has lived only
to eat and drink, to retail the gossip
of the hour, and yawn through the
day. He has abandoned <em>all religion</em>,
and professes to think all creeds alike.
His morals are of the same quality
with his religion, and he creeps
through society as worthless as the
worm that shall soon feed on his
better half—his body—in the grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Hardwicke had now full opportunity
for the display of all his
talents; and their combination in one
man was certainly an extraordinary
evidence of the powers of discipline
and nature. He was at once a first-rate
lawyer, a first-rate statesman,
and a first-rate public speaker. Any
one of those high attainments might
bring sufficient to make the business
of a life—in him they were the easy
attributes of a master-mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>His oratory was not of the school
which afterwards gave such eminence
to Chatham. It had none of the
brilliant impetuosity of that Demosthenes
of English orators; but it had
a captivation—the captivation of eloquence
and grace—which gave interest
even to the driest details of the
tribunal. Lord Camden, himself a
powerful public speaker, thus described
Hardwicke on the bench:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the Court of Chancery, multitudes
would flock to hear the Lord
Chancellor, as <em>to hear Garrick</em>. His
clearness, arrangement, and comprehension
of his subject, were masterly.
But his <em>address</em> in the turn which he
gave to all, whether he was in the
right, or was ‘to make the worse
appear the better reason,’ was like
<em>magic</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His high employments now brought
opulence with them; and he purchased
from Lord Oxford the fine
estate of Wimpole, in Cambridgeshire,
which had come into the Oxford
family by marriage with the Duke of
Newcastle’s heiress. In 1740, Philip
Yorke, the Chancellor’s eldest son,
married the daughter of Lord Breadalbane,
and grand-daughter of the
Duke of Kent. Horace Walpole, in
his correspondence with Conway,
thus smartly sums up the good fortune
of this most prosperous family:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harry, what luck the Chancellor
has! first, indeed, to be in himself
so great a man. But then, in accidents.
He is made Chief Justice
and Peer, when Talbot is made
Chancellor and Peer. Talbot dies
in a twelvemonth, and leaves him
the Seals, at an age when others
are scarcely made solicitors. Then
he marries his son into one of the
first families of Britain, obtains a
patent for a marquisate, and eight
thousand pounds a-year, after the
Duke of Kent’s death. The Duke
<em>dies in a fortnight</em>, and leaves them
all! People talk of fortune’s wheel
that is always rolling; troth, my Lord
Hardwicke has overtaken her wheel,
and rolled along with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The present attempt to give legislative
power to the Jews, an attempt
whose success would inevitably change
the <em>Christian character</em> of the legislature,
gives a revived interest to the
following decision of the great Chancellor.
A legacy of £12,000 having
been left by a Jew, “for establishing
an assembly for reading and improving
the Jewish law,” and the case
having been brought into court, the
Chancellor decided against the application
of the legacy. The note of
this judgment, recorded in his own
note-book, is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was of opinion, that this appeared
to be a charitable bequest or
fund for promoting and propagating
the Jewish religion, and consequently
<em>contrary to law</em>. For that the Christian
religion <em>is part of the law of the
land</em>, and involved in the <em>constitution
of this kingdom</em>, according to my Lord
Hale in Taylor’s case, 1 Ventr.,
and my Lord Raymond in Wolston’s
case; and that it differed widely from
the cases of charitable benefactions to
the meeting-houses or congregations
of Protestant dissenters, which are
tolerated, and regulated by the Toleration
Act. Therefore, I <em>refused</em> to
decree for this charity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In March 1745, died the celebrated
Sir Robert Walpole: of all the ministers
of George the Second the most
trusted, and of all the ministers of
England the most unpopular; of all
the statesmen of his day the most
successful, and certainly, of all the
public men of England, regarded, in
his own time, as the most unscrupulous.
If it be doubted that he was
personally more unprincipled than
other ministers, to him unquestionably
was due the <em>practice</em> of corruption
as an established principle of
government. That any minister
could have dared to adopt such a
system in England, is to be accounted
for only by the rapid changes of party
since the beginning of the century,
the changes of the Succession, the
timidity of the press, yet but in its
infancy, and the unsettled nature of
the Brunswick throne.</p>

<p class='c009'>In late years, Burke, inflamed with
the love of splendid paradox, and
delighting in the novelty of imagining
personal virtue in the midst of public
vice, amused his genius with throwing
a factitious lustre over the memory
of Walpole. But the voice of
contemporary writers has been since
amply echoed by the judgment of
history. Walpole <em>was</em> a corrupter;
and, if the progress of his system had
not been broken short by his fall, and
by the hurried successions of ministers
from each side of the House
alternately, the government would
perhaps have perished, or could have
purified itself only by a revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>Walpole was a first-rate man of
<em>craft</em>; his sagacity was vigilant; his
industry was indefatigable; his speech
plausible, and his management of the
uncouth and suspicious King dexterous
in a remarkable degree. But he
lowered the whole tone of public life.
No act of magnanimous policy ever
originated with Walpole. He made
no attempt, or but of the feeblest
order, to add to the national intelligence.
He encouraged none of the
higher provinces of the arts, learning,
or science; and, though he gave
mitres to Butler, Gibson, and Sherlock,
yet the religion of England
languished scarcely less than its
philosophy. It was what Burke himself
subsequently termed its succeeding
period, “burgomaster age,” and
parliament was scarcely more than a
Dutch council, until Chatham came
and startled it again into life. Walpole
obtains credit with posterity for
the moderation of his wealth. But,
beginning as the son of a country
gentleman, he purchased a fine
estate; he built a magnificent mansion,
Houghton; he collected one of
the finest private picture-galleries in
Europe; and he always lived, so far
as we can learn, in great affluence
and expenditure.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the country was suddenly to
be tried by a new and most formidable
hazard. News arrived in London
that the Prince Charles Edward,
the eldest son of the Pretender, had
landed in Scotland, had raised the
standard of the Stuarts, had been
joined by some of the clans, and was
determined on marching to the metropolis.
This part of the Memoir is
peculiarly interesting, from its giving
the private impressions of individuals
of rank and importance, on the everyday
movements of the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 1st of August, Lady Hardwicke,
who was, of course, acquainted
with all the opinions of government,
writes to her son Philip Yorke, who
was then out of town:—“My heart is
very heavy. Our folks are very busy
at this time, by fresh alarms of the
Pretender being in Scotland. But I
believe the ship Captain Bret fought
was the ship he was in. If it be so,
he is not yet got there; which may
give a little more time to prepare for
him. The French disclaim sending
him there; but that is nothing. They
are to take Ostend; while Spain sends
troops thence, to the other end of the
kingdom, to distract our measures.
This is my opinion, God grant I may
be in the wrong. In the mean time,
our king’s abroad, and our troops also.
There comes out a proclamation this
day, offering a reward for the Pretender,
as I am informed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Hardwicke had been appointed
one of the Regency, on the King’s absence
in Germany. And his views of
the crisis were gloomy enough. In a
letter to Lord Glenorchy (August 15)
he says, “On Tuesday last we received
advice from the Duke of Argyle and
my Lord Justice Clerk, that the young
Pretender was landed in the north-west
parts of the Highlands. He is
said to have come in a single ship of
16 or 18 guns, attended by about 70
persons, among whom are Lord Tullibardine
and old Lochiel. When I look
round me, and consider our whole situation,
<em>our all appears to be at stake</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The yachts sailed this morning
for the King, who has declared he will
set out from Hanover, as soon as he
has heard they have arrived on the
other side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was desponding language from
so eminent a person, but it was produced
by deeper feelings than alarm
at the landing of a few people in the
north, though with a prince at their
head. The plain truth, and no man
was better aware of it than Hardwicke,
was, that the conduct of the
late Cabinet had utterly disgusted the
nation. The contempt justly felt for
Walpole had spread to higher objects;
and the nation looked with an ominous
quietude on the coming struggle between
the young Chevalier and the
possessor of the throne. As if the factions
of parliament had been preparing
for the success of the Stuarts, all their
efforts for the last ten years had been
directed to dismantle the country; all
their harangues were turned to extinguishing
the army, which they described
as at once ruinous to the
finances, and dangerous to the liberties
of the country. Probably there
was not a man of all those declaimers
who believed a single syllable which
he uttered; but “Reduction” was the
party cry. With France in immense
military power; with the Stuarts living
under its protection; with the whole
force of Popery intriguing throughout
the country; and with a great number
of weak people, who thought that
their consciences called for the return
of the exiled dynasty in the person of
the Pretender, the reduction of the
national defences by the ministry fell
little short of treason. But when the
intelligence of the prince’s arrival was
brought to London, the kingdom seems
to have been left almost without a
soldier; every battalion being engaged
in the lingering war in Germany. The
King had not added to the strength of
his government; his passion for going
to Hanover had occasioned obvious
public inconvenience, and his absence
at the moment of public peril was felt
with peculiar irritability. The Chancellor,
on this subject, after alluding
to his recovery from a slight illness,
says, “Would to God, the state of our
affairs were as much mended; but the
clouds continue as black as ever; and
how soon the storm may burst on us,
we know not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the first news of the Chevalier’s
landing, a message had been sent to
the King, to return with all haste,
which he did, as is mentioned in a
letter of the Chancellor to the Archbishop
of York. After speaking of the
difficulties of government, the letter
closes with, “I had writ thus far, when
a messenger from Margate brought the
good news that the King landed there
about half an hour after three this
morning, and would be at Kensington
within two hours. Accordingly, his
Majesty arrived there about two
o’clock, in perfect health. I really think
I never saw him look better in my life.
He appears also to be in very good
humour, and to value himself upon the
haste he has made to us, when there
was any apprehension of danger affecting
this country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In another letter, he sadly laments
the absence of all public interest in the
event of the Rebellion. “Can you
tell what will make <em>double hearts</em> true?...
I have not slept these two
nights; <em>but sweat and prayed</em>....
The Duke of Argyle is come to town,
and done nothing; and Duke Athol
is gone to a town in the Highlands,
and does nothing neither. He has
had Glengarrie with him, whose clan
has joined the Pretender, and he is
gone from him. In short, every thing
is in a strange way, and nobody,
hardly, is affected as they ought; at
least as I am.... This is the real
state of things, however they may be
disguised, and I fear Sir J. Cope’s <em>not
equal to his business</em>. God alone can
save us, to whose merciful judgment
we trust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The late Sydney Smith’s pleasantries
on the novelty of invasion
ideas in the brains of John Bull, and
the difficulty of convincing him of the
possibilities of such a thing, were fully
exemplified in the cabinet, as well as
in the people. The cabinet did little
more than send for the King, and the
King did little more than send an incompetent
officer with a small detachment
of troops to put down a rebellion
which might have already enlisted the
whole martial population of Scotland;
even the Chancellor could not restrain
himself from running down to one or
other of his country houses, for two or
three days at a time, while the government
was actually trembling from
hour to hour on the verge of the scaffold.
This childish inability of self-control
disparages the conduct of so
distinguished a person. But with all
his “sweating and praying,” he seems
to have been totally incapable of denying
himself this pitiful indulgence,
when a week might see the Stuarts
on the throne. At length troops
were ordered from Germany, and six
thousand arrived with General Ligonier.
Some Dutch regiments followed;
five men-of-war returned
from the Mediterranean, and the
British regiments were on their march
through Holland. In the mean time
came the startling announcement that
the Pretender was in Edinburgh, that
he was proclaimed there, and that he
was royally lodged in Holyrood
House. The Chancellor’s fears of
Cope’s inefficiency were soon shown
to have been prophetic. Cope had
been sent to save Edinburgh,—the
clans outmarched him, and Cope had
no resource but to land at Dunbar.
At Haddington he suddenly found the
clans to the south of his force. They
were about three thousand, half armed,
to his two thousand two hundred disciplined
troops; the Highlanders rushed
upon him and routed him in a moment.
The Chevalier returned to Edinburgh
with a hundred pipers leading the
march, and playing, “The king shall
have his own again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The person who figures mainly at
this period, and who appears to have
shown alike good sense and courage,
was Herring, Archbishop of York, an
old friend of the Chancellor, who had
recommended him to the government
when but preacher at Lincoln’s Inn,
obtained for him a bishopric, and
pushed him forward into the Archbishopric
of York. Herring was
afterwards promoted to Canterbury,
perhaps as a reward of his loyalty
and manliness in this delicate and difficult
time. Herring was evidently
a sensible and high-minded man, and
his letters to the Chancellor figure
conspicuously among the mass of correspondence
received by Hardwicke.
On the battle of Prestonpans, this
vigorous prelate thus wrote:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I conceal it, but I own I conceive
terrible apprehensions from the affair
at Prestonpans, where the conduct of
our general, &#38;c., was —— I won’t
give it the right name, but that of the
rebels excellent; and, from what I
can collect, and the judgment which I
form upon the opinion of the soldiers
here, they are admirably disciplined,
and, our soldiers have felt, well armed.
They showed resolution and conduct in
taking the little battery, and as they are
vigorous and savage, their leaders well
know how to point their strength properly
and effectually. There is something,
too, in their artful taciturnity
that alarms one. They say it is a fact
that from their setting out to this hour
it is not easy to say who leads them,
nor are they seen in a manner till they
are felt, so silent and well conceived
are their motions. I hope all this is
known above much better than it is
here, and that it is now seen that this
rebellion is not to be quashed by small
pelotons of an army, but must be attended
to <i><span lang="la">totis viribus</span></i>. Who can say
what will be the consequence of such
an advantage gained in England?” In
another letter Herring mentions that
a meeting of the county was held at
York, at which he presided.</p>

<p class='c009'>London was of course full of rumours,
and a letter from Lady
Hardwicke gives them in grave yet
ridiculous detail. After saying that
the merchants had stopped the run
upon the bank, she mentions a report
that the Chancellor was turned out;
that the Duke of Newcastle and his
brother had run away, some said,
to the Pretender; and others, that
Lestock, the Admiral, had produced
three letters from him forbidding him
to fight; and these reports gained a
universal run. People were told at
the turnpikes as they passed through,
that London was in an uproar and his
Grace fled. Nay, the mobs gathered
in crowds about his house, and saw
some of the shutters unopened, whence
they concluded he was gone; and
when he went out they surrounded his
chariot, and looked him in the face
and said, “It is he! he is not gone.
What is our condition, when such
monstrous lies are spread to increase
the terrors of honest minds?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Archbishop’s exertions gave
great satisfaction to the King, whom
he had so worthily and courageously
served; and the Chancellor immediately
wrote him an account of an
interview which he had with his Majesty
on the occasion. “I own,” said
he, “I feel a particular pleasure in
the great and noble part which your
Grace has taken on this occasion, and
in the gallant, wise, and becoming
manner in which you have exerted
yourself. I was so full of it, that I went
immediately to Kensington, and gave
the King an ample account of it in his
closet. I found him apprised of it in
the Lord Lieutenant’s letters, which
he had received from the Duke of Newcastle;
but he was so pleased with it
that he was desirous of hearing it over
again. I informed his Majesty of the
substance of your letter, the sermon
your Grace had preached last Sunday,
and with such prodigious expedition
printed and dispersed; and when I
came to your speech, he desired me to
show it him. His Majesty read it over
from beginning to end, gave it the
just praise it so highly deserves, and
said it must be printed. I told him I
believed it was printing at York, but
it is determined to print it in the Gazette.
When I had gone through this
part, I said, your Majesty will give
me leave to acquaint my Lord Archbishop
that you approve his zeal
and activity in your service—to which
the King answered quick, My lord,
that is not enough; you must also tell
the Archbishop that I heartily thank
him for it. His Majesty also highly
applauded the affection, zeal, and unanimity
which had appeared in the
several lords and gentlemen on this
occasion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chancellor also informs him
that ten British regiments had arrived
from Flanders, and that eight battalions
more, and 1500 dragoons were
ordered to embark. He then makes
a natural and just remark on the faction
that had clamoured against putting
the country into a state of defence. “I
know some friends of yours who had
talked themselves hoarse in contending
for this measure, and whose advice,
if followed some time ago, might
have prevented, in all human probability,
this dismal scene. But the conduct
of <em>some persons</em> on this occasion has
been infamous.” He then marks the
true conduct to be adopted in all instances
of civil war. “A great body
of forces will forthwith be sent to the
North. I contend every where, that
they must be a <em>great body</em>, for the protection
of the King’s crown and his
people. The work of the Revolution,
which has been building up these
seven-and-fifty years, must not be
risked upon an even chance.” Such
is true policy. The defence of an empire
must not be risked upon a chance;
the benighted and dishonest theorists,
who would enfeeble the defences
of England in our day, for the
sake of gaining the clamour of a mob,
would be the first to fly in the hour of
danger; and although the <em>certainty</em> of
a French war from the ambition of the
monarchy, is at an end, and the
Prince de Joinville is not likely to
realise the suggestions of his detestable
pamphlet, and have the honour
of pouncing on our sea-coast villages;
a Republic is a neighbour to which we
have not been accustomed for a long
while, and which, with the best intentions
for the present, may very suddenly
change its mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another letter from Herring shows
the gallant spirit which may exist
under lawn sleeves. “I purposed,”
said he, “to have set out for London
on Wednesday; but I have had a
sort of remembrance from the city
here (York) that it will create some
uneasiness. There is a great matter in
opinion; and if my attendance at
Bishopsthorpe serves to support a
spirit, or to preserve a union, or that
the people think so, I will not stir....
I have therefore put off my journey,
but ordered my affairs so, that at the
least intimation from your Lordship,
I can <i><span lang="la">vasa conclamare</span></i>, and set out in
an hour. To talk in the style military,
(though my red coat is not made yet,)
the first <em>column</em> of my family went off
a week ago, the second moves on
Wednesday, and the third attends my
motions. I purpose to leave my house
in a condition to receive the Marshal,
if he pleases to make use of it. And
there is a sort of policy in my civility,
too; for while he occupies it, it cannot
be plundered. I know your Lordship
has ever an anxiety for your friends.
But, if I must fly, the General and his
hussars have offered to cover my retreat.
But enough of this; I had
rather laugh when the battle is won,
and could not help putting up an
ejaculation at the pond-side to-night,—Heaven
grant I may feed my
swans in peace!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mention of the red coat was
probably suggested by a report that
the Archbishop had been seen in uniform.
And the “hussars” were a
troop of young gentlemen, whom General
Oglethorpe had embodied at York.</p>

<p class='c009'>The prelate was somewhat of a
humorist; and he thus writes on his
military reputation:—“I find I must
go into regimentals, in my own defence,
in a double sense; for an
engraver has already given me a
Saracen’s head, surrounded with a
chevalier in chains, and all the instruments
of war, and the hydra of rebellion
at my feet. And I see another
copperplate promised, where I am to
be exhibited in the same martial attitude,
with all my clergy with me.
By my troth, as I judge from applications
made to me every day, I believe
I could raise a regiment of my own
order. And I had a serious offer the
other day from a Welch curate, from
the bottom of Merionethshire, who is
six feet and a half high, that, hearing
that I had put on scarlet, he was
ready to attend me at an hour’s warning,
if the Bishop of Bangor did not
call upon him for the same service.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The disregard of all preparation had
left the whole English border defenceless.
Hull and Carlisle were the only
towns which had any means of resistance.
York had walls, but they
were in a state of decay, and had not
a single piece of artillery. Thus the
invaders were enabled to pursue any
road which they pleased. But their
entrance into England should have
taught them that their enterprise had
become hopeless. The country people
every where fled before them—the
roads were filled with the carriages
and waggons of the gentry hurrying
to places of safety. No gentleman of
rank joined them. One army was on
their rear, and the main army, under
the Duke of Cumberland, was between
them and London.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the metropolis, the spirit of the
people, always slow, until the danger
is visible, now awoke. The lawyers,
in a procession of two hundred and
fifty carriages, carried up an address
to the King, assuring him of their
loyalty. The trained bands were
summoned. Troops were sent to the
coast to watch the French, if they
should attempt invasion; alarm-posts
and signals were appointed in case of
tumults in London, and the capital
was at length in safety against a much
superior force to that of the Chevalier.
But in December the gratifying news
came, that on the 5th the invaders
had retired from Derby, and were
rapidly returning to the North.</p>

<p class='c009'>The disorder and exhaustion of
those gallant but unfortunate men,
must have left them an easy prey to
the superior forces which were now
on their track, when the pursuit was
suddenly stopped by an alarm of
French invasion. Twelve thousand
men had suddenly been collected; the
Duke of Richelieu, with the Pretender’s
second son, had come to Dunkirk;
transports were gathered along the
coast; and the invasion would probably
have been attempted, but for a
storm which drove many of their ships
ashore near Calais. The troops in
London were but six thousand! The
16th of April, at Culloden, closed this
most unhappy struggle, and gave an
internal peace to England which has
never been broken.</p>

<p class='c009'>The remarks in the memoir on this
daring enterprise seem to be imperfect.
The first is, that if England was to
have been invaded at all, the effort
should have been made before the
army could be brought from Flanders.
The second is, that the retreat from
Derby should have been exchanged
for a march on London. But the
former would have required a totally
different plan of operations. The
Prince should have landed in Kent,
if his object was to take London by
surprise. But, as his only troops must
be the clans, he must look for them
in the North; and it would have been
impossible to march an army from the
Highlands to the metropolis in less
than a fortnight. On the second
point, the retreat from Derby was
obviously necessary. The clans were
already diminishing—every step must
be fought for—they were but half
armed—and the King’s troops were
increasing day by day.</p>

<p class='c009'>In one remark we agree, that the
Chevalier should never have attempted
more than the possession of Scotland.
He should have remained in Holyrood
House. There he had a majority of
the nation in his favour,—the heads
of the clans, and the old romantic recollections
of his ancestral kings, all
tending to support his throne. A
French force might have been easily
summoned to his assistance, and for a
while he might have maintained a
separate sovereignty. It is, on the
other hand, not improbable that the
Scottish nation might have looked on
the sovereignty of a son of James, the
persecutor, with jealousy; Protestantism
would have dreaded a French
alliance; and the expulsion of the
Chevalier would have been effected
in Scotland on the model of the English
expulsion of James. Still, the
experiment was feasible for the claimant
of a crown; and the success of the
adventure might have continued long
enough to produce great evil to both
countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have found these volumes highly
interesting, not merely from the
importance of their period, but from
their containing events so curiously
parallel to those of our own time.
Among the rest was the appointment
to the Archbishopric of Canterbury.
A letter from Charles Yorke thus
says:—“The Archbishop of Canterbury
died suddenly on Saturday.
The Bishop of London has declined
the offer of succeeding. It is now
offered to the Bishop of Salisbury,
who has not yet returned an answer.
If he refuses, which some say he will,
the Archbishop of York will be the
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The reasons for these refusals were
probably the reluctance to change, at
the advanced age of these bishops,—Sherlock,
of Salisbury, being seventy,
and Gibson probably about the same
age. The fees for possession are also
immense, and we have heard them
rated at little short of £20,000.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lord Chancellor announced the
offer to the Archbishop of York, who
returned the following remarkable
answer:—“I am honoured with your
Lordship’s of the 13th inst., which I
embrace with all my heart, as a new
instance of that friendship and affection
for me which for so many years
have been the support, and credit, and
comfort of my life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have considered the thing, my
best friend and my most honoured
Lord, with all deliberation and compass
of thought that I am master of,
and am come to a very firm and most
resolved determination not to quit the
See of York on any account or on any
consideration.... I am really
poor; I am not ambitious of being
rich, but have too much pride, with, I
hope, a small mixture of honesty, to
bear being in debt. I am now out of
it, and in possession of a clear independency
of that sort. I must not go
back, and begin the world again at
fifty-five.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The honour of Canterbury is a
thing of glare and splendour, and the
hopes of it a <em>proper incentive to schoolboys</em>
to industry. But I have considered
all its inward parts, and examined
all its duties, and if I should
quit my present station to take it, I
will not answer for it that in less than
a twelvemonth I did not sink and die
with regret and envy at the man who
should succeed me here, and quit the
place in my possession, as I ought to
do, to one better and wiser than myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This language might have been received
with some suspicion in other
instances; but Herring was a straightforward
as well as a very able man,
and there can be no doubt that he
spoke what he thought. But he seems
to have mistaken the position of the
Primate as one of splendour, for we
certainly have seen instances in which
it displayed any thing but splendour,
and in which the great body of the
clergy knew no more of the halls of
Lambeth, shared no more of its due
hospitality, and enjoyed no more of the
natural and becoming intercourse with
their metropolitan, than if he had been
a hermit. This grievous error, which
has the necessary effect of repelling
and ultimately offending and alienating
the whole body of the inferior
clergy, a body who constitute the
active strength of the Establishment,
we must hope to see henceforth totally
changed. In the higher view of the
case, an Archbishop of Canterbury
possesses every advantage for giving
an honourable and meritorious popularity
to the Church. By his rank,
entitled to associate with the highest
personages of the empire, he may
more powerfully influence them by the
manliness and intelligence of his opinions:
a peer of parliament, he should
be a leader of council, the spokesman
of the prelacy, the guide of the peers
on all ecclesiastical questions, and the
courageous protector of the Establishment
committed to his charge. In
his more private course, he ought to
cultivate the association of the learned,
the vigorous, and the active minds
of the country. He ought especially
to be kind to his clergy, not merely
by opening his palace and his hospitalities
to them all, but by personal
intercourse, by visiting their
churches, by preaching from time to
time in their pulpits, by making himself
known to them in the general civilities
of private friendliness, and by the
easy attentions which, more than all
the formalities of official condescension,
sink into the hearts of men. It
is absurd and untrue to say that an
archbishop has no time for all these
things. These things are of the simplest
facility to any man whose heart
is in the right place; and if, instead of
locking himself up with two or three
dreary effigies of man, in the shape of
chaplains, and freezing all the soul
within him by a rigid and repulsive
routine, he shall “do as he would be
done unto” if he had remained a
country curate, an Archbishop of
Canterbury might be the most beloved,
popular, and for all the best
purposes, the most influential man in
the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old age was now coming on Lord
Hardwicke, and with it the painful
accompaniment of the loss of his old
and intimate associates through public
and private life; his own public
career, too, was come to its close.
In 1756 the Newcastle ministry was
succeeded by that of the celebrated
William Pitt, (Lord Chatham,) and
Lord Hardwicke resigned the Great
Seal. The note in his private journal
states, “19th November 1756, resigned
the Great Seal voluntarily into
his Majesty’s hands at St James’s,
after I had held it nineteen years,
eight months, and ten days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All authorities since his day appear
to have agreed in giving the highest
tribute to this distinguished man.
His character in the <cite>Annual Register</cite>
says, “In judicature, his firmness and
dignity were evidently derived from
his consummate knowledge and
talents; and the mildness and humanity
which tempered it from the best
heart.... His extraordinary
despatch of the business of the court,
increased as it was in his time beyond
what had been known in any former,
on account of his established reputation
there, and the extension of the
commerce and riches of the nation,
was an advantage to the suitor, inferior
only to that arising from the
acknowledged equity, perspicuity,
and precision of his decrees....
The manner in which he presided in
the House of Lords added order and
dignity to that assembly.” Lord
Campbell, in his late “Lives of the
Chancellors,” characterises Lord
Hardwicke as “the man universally
and deservedly considered the most
consummate judge who <em>ever sat</em> in the
Court of Chancery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An instance of his grace of manner
even in rebuke, amply deserves to be
recorded. A cause was argued in
Chancery, in which a grandson of
Oliver Cromwell, and bearing the
same name, was a party. The opposing
counsel began to cast some
reflections on the memory of his
eminent ancestor; on which the
Chancellor quietly said, “I observe
Mr Cromwell standing outside the
bar, inconveniently pressed by the
crowd; make way for him, that he
may <em>sit by me on the Bench</em>.” This
had the effect of silencing the sarcasms
of the advocate. Lord Hardwicke
seems to have excited a professional
deference for his legal conduct and
abilities, which at this distance of
time it is difficult even to imagine.
But the highest names of the Bar
seem to have exhausted language in
his panegyric. Lord Mansfield thus
spoke of him on being requested by a
lawyer to give him materials for his
biography. The answer is worth retaining
for every reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My success in life is not very remarkable.
My father was a man of
rank and fashion. Early in life I
was introduced into the best company,
and my circumstances enabled
me to support the character of a man
of fortune. To these advantages I
chiefly owe <em>my</em> success. And therefore
my life cannot be very interesting.
But if you wish to employ your abilities
in writing the life of a truly <em>great</em>
and <em>wonderful</em> man in our profession,
take the life of Lord Hardwicke for
your object. He was indeed a wonderful
character. He became Chief
Justice of England and Chancellor
from his own abilities and virtues; for
he was the son of a peasant!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not exactly so, as we have seen;
for his father was a respectable man,
who gave him a legal education. But
the great Chancellor certainly owed
but little to birth or fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have heard much of the elegance
and polish of Mansfield’s style,
but, from the imperfect reports of public
speeches a hundred years ago,
have had but few evidences of its
charm. One precious relic, however,
these volumes have preserved. On
his taking leave of the society of
Lincolns Inn, (on his being raised to
the Bench,) the usual complimentary
address was made by Mr Charles
Yorke. The reply, of which we give
but a sentence, was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I have had in any measure
success in my profession, it is owing
to the great man who has presided in
our highest courts of judicature the
whole time I attended the bar. It
was impossible to attend him, to sit
under him every day, without catching
some beams from his light. The
disciples of Socrates, whom I will
take the liberty to call the great
lawyer of antiquity, since the first
principles of all law are derived from
his philosophy, owe their reputation
to their having been the repeaters of
the sayings of their great master. If
<em>we</em> can arrogate nothing to ourselves,
we can boast of the school we were
brought up in. The scholar may
glory in his master, and we may
challenge past ages to show us his
equal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After brief allusions to the three
great names of Bacon, Clarendon, and
Somers, all of whom he regarded as
inferior either in moral or natural
distinctions, he said,—“It is the
peculiar felicity of the great man of
whom I am speaking, to have presided
for nearly twenty years, and to
have shone with a splendour that has
risen superior to faction, and that has
subdued envy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The melancholy case of Admiral
Byng occurred in this year, (1757)
and is well reasoned in this work. The
writer thinks that the execution was
just. A death by law is naturally
distressing to the feelings of humanity,
and the degradation or banishment of
the unfortunate admiral might possibly
have had all the effects of the
final punishment, without giving so
much pain to the public feelings.
Still, the cabinet might justly complain
of the clamour raised against
their act, by the party who arraigned
them for the death of Byng. In
command of a great fleet on a most
important occasion, he had totally
failed, and failed in despite of the
opinions of his own officers. He had
been sent for the express purpose of
relieving the British garrison of Minorca,
and he was scared away by
the chance of encountering the French
fleet: the consequence was, the surrender
of the island, and the capture
of the garrison. On his return to
England, he was tried and found
guilty by a court-martial: he was
found guilty by the general opinion of
the legislature and the nation; and
though the court-martial recommended
him to mercy, on the ground that
his offence was not poltroonery, but
an “error in judgment;” yet his reluctance
to fight the French had produced
such ruinous consequences, and
had involved the navy in such European
disgrace, that the King determined
on his death, and he died
accordingly. An error in judgment
which consists in <em>not</em> fighting, naturally
seems, to a brave people, a
wholly different offence from the error
which consists in grappling with the
enemy. And, though Voltaire’s sarcasm,
that Byng was shot <i><span lang="fr">pour
encourager les autres</span></i>, had all the pungency
of the Frenchman’s wit, and
though British admirals could require
no stimulant to their courage from
the fear of a similar fate, there can
be but little doubt that this execution
helped to make up the decisions of
many a perplexed mind in after times.
The man who fights needs have no
fear of court-martials in England.
This was a most important point
gained. The greatest of living soldiers
has said, that the only fault which he
had to find with any of his generals,
was their dread of responsibility.
The court-martial of Byng taught the
British captains, in the phrase of the
immortal Nelson, that “the officer
who grapples with his enemy, can
never be wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 25th of October King George
II. died. He had been in good health
previously, had risen from bed, taken
his chocolate, and talked of walking
in the gardens of Kensington. The
page had left the room, and hearing a
noise of something falling, hurried
back. He found the King on the
floor, who only said, “Call Amelia,”
and expired. He was seventy-seven
years old, and had reigned thirty-four
years.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King left but few recollections,
and those negative. He had not connected
himself with the feelings of
the country; he had not patronised
the fine arts, nor protected literature.
He was wholly devoted to continental
politics, and had adhered to
some continental habits, which increased
his unpopularity with the
graver portion of the people of England.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1763 Lord Hardwicke’s health
began visibly to give way. He had
lost his wife, and had lost his old
friend the Duke of Newcastle. Death
was every where among the circle of
those distinguished persons who had
been the companions of his active days.
He had great comfort, however, in
that highest of comforts to old age,
the distinctions and talents of his sons,
who had all risen into public rank.
But the common fate of all mankind
had now come upon him; and on the
6th of March he breathed his last.
“Serene and composed, I saw him in
his last moments, and he looked like
an innocent child in its nurse’s arms,”
is the note of his son. He was seventy-four.
His remains were interred in
the parish church of Wimpole.</p>

<p class='c009'>The peerage and estates still continue
in the family, and are now
represented by the estimable and intelligent
son of the late Admiral Sir
Joseph Yorke. On the death of the
Chancellor’s eldest son, who had succeeded
to the title, the eldest son of
Mr Charles Yorke became Lord
Hardwicke. This nobleman, who was
remarkable for scholarship and refinement
of taste, had held the anxious
office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in
the year of the Rebellion 1798. His
son, Lord Royston, a very accomplished
person, being lost by shipwreck
in the seas, the son of the well-known
admiral, who had been so unhappily
killed by a flash of lightning
in a boat off Portsmouth, became
the heir.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is in the history of men like Lord
Hardwicke that England justly prides
herself. Here is an instance of the
prizes which lie before the vigour,
talents, and principles of her great
men. The son of a country solicitor
rises to the highest rank of a subject,
forces his way through all the obstacles
of narrow means, professional prejudice,
learned difficulty, and humble
birth; takes his place among the first
ranks of the aristocracy, guides the
law, shares in the first influence of the
state, is the pillar of government, and
chief councillor of his king; accumulates
a vast fortune, becomes master
of magnificent estates, and founds a
family holding in succession distinguished
offices in church and state,
and still forming a portion of the nobility
of England. And all this was
done by the talents of a single individual.
Long may the constitution
live which offers such triumphs to
integrity and learning, and glory be
to the country which has such men,
and fixes her especial renown on their
fame!</p>

<p class='c009'>The biography is vigorous, intelligent,
and remarkably interesting. No
historian can in future write the
“Reign of George II.” without it. It
passes through times of singular
importance: and while the volumes
are essential to the student of legal
history, they offer a high gratification
to the general reader.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>HOW WE GOT POSSESSION OF THE TUILLERIES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c022'>CHAPTER I.<br> HEADS OR TAILS?</h3>

<p class='c023'>I like political ovations. It is a
very pleasant thing to perambulate
Europe in the guise of a regenerator,
sowing the good seed of political
economy in places which have hitherto
been barren, and enlightening
the heathen upon the texture of
calico, and the blessings of unreciprocal
free-trade. I rather flatter myself
that I have excited considerable
sensation in certain quarters of Europe,
previously plunged in darkness, and
unillumined by the argand lamp of
Manchester philosophy. Since September
last, I have not been idle, but
have borne the banner of regeneration
from the Baltic to the shores of the
Bosphorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the apostle of peace and plenty,
I have every where been rapturously
greeted. Never, I believe, was there a
sincerer, a more earnest wish prevalent
throughout the nations for the maintenance
of universal tranquillity than
now; never a better security for that
fraternisation which we all so earnestly
desire; never a more peaceful or unrevolutionary
epoch. Such, at least,
were my ideas a short time ago, when,
after having fulfilled a secret mission
of some delicacy in a very distant part
of the Continent, I turned my face
homewards, and retraced my steps
in the direction of my own Glaswegian
Mecca. In passing through
Italy, I found that country deeply
engaged in plans of social organisation,
and much cheered by the sympathising
presence of a member of her Britannic
Majesty’s cabinet. It was delightful
to witness the good feeling which
seemed to prevail between the British
unaccredited minister and the scum
of the Ausonian population,—the
mutual politeness and sympathy exhibited
by each of the high contracting
parties,—and the perfect understanding
on the part of the Lazzaroni,
of the motives which had induced the
northern peer to absent himself from
felicity awhile, and devote the whole
of his vast talents and genius to the
cause of foreign insurrection. I had
just time to congratulate Pope Pius
upon the charming prospect which
was before him, and to say a few
hurried words regarding the superiority
of cotton to Christianity as a
universal tranquillising medium, when
certain unpleasant rumours from the
frontier forced their way to the
Eternal City, and convinced me of the
propriety of continuing my retreat
towards the land of my nativity.
Not that I fear steel, or have any
abstract repugnance to grape, but
my mission was emphatically one
of peace; I had a great duty to
discharge to my country, and that
might have been lamentably curtailed
by the bullet of some blundering
Austrian.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behold me, then, at Paris—that
Aspasian capital of the world. I had
often visited it before in the character
of a tourist and literateur, but never
until now as a politician. True, I
was not accredited: I enjoyed neither
diplomatic rank, nor the more soothing
salary which is its accompaniment.
But, in these times, such
distinctions are rapidly fading away.
I had seen with my own eyes a good
deal of spontaneous diplomacy, which
certainly did not seem to flow in the
regular channel; and, furthermore, I
could personally testify to the weight
attached abroad to private commercial
crusades. I needed no official
costume; I was the representative of
a popular movement; I was the
champion of a class; and my name
and my principles were alike familiar
to the ears of the illuminati of Europe.
Formerly I had been proud of associating
with Eugène Sue, Charles
Nodier, Paul de Kock, and other
characters of ephemeral literary celebrity;
I had wasted my time in orgies
at the Café de Londres, or the Rocher
de Cancale, and was but too happy
to be admitted to those little parties
of pleasure in which the majority
of the cavaliers are feuilletonists, and
the dames, terrestrial stars from the
constellation of the Théatre des Variétés.
Now I looked back on this
former phase of my existence with a
consciousness of having wasted my
energies. I had shot into another
sphere—was entitled to take rank
with Thiers, Odillon Barrot, Crémieux,
and other champions of the people;
and I resolved to comport myself
accordingly. I do not feel at liberty
to enter into the exact details of the
public business which detained me
for some time in Paris. It is enough
to say, that I was warmly and cordially
received, and on the best possible
terms with the members of the
<i><span lang="fr">extreme gauche</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>One afternoon about the middle of
February, I was returning from the
Chamber of Deputies, meditating very
seriously upon the nature of a debate
which I had just heard, regarding the
opposition of ministers to the holding
of a Reform banquet in Paris, and
in which my friend Barrot had borne
a very conspicuous share. At the
corner of the Place de la Concorde, I
observed a tall swarthy man in the
uniform of the National Guard, engaged
in cheapening a poodle. I thought I recognised
the face—hesitated, stopped,
and in a moment was in the arms of
my illustrious friend, the Count of
Monte-Christo, and Marquis Davy de
la Pailleterie!</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Capdibious!</em>” cried the author of
Trois Mousquetaires—“Who would
have thought to see you here?
Welcome, my dear Dunshunner, a
thousand times to Paris. Where have
you been these hundred years?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Voyaging, like yourself, to the
East, my dear Marquis,” replied I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, bah! That is an old joke. I
never was nearer Egypt than the Bois
de Boulogne; however, I did manage
to mystify the good public about the
baths of Alexandria. But how came
you here just now? <i><span lang="fr">Dix mille tonnerres!</span></i>
They told me you had been
made <i><span lang="fr">pair d’Angleterre</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no; not exactly. There
was some talk of it, I believe. But
jealousy—jealousy, you know—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes,—I comprehend! <i><span lang="fr">Ce vilain
Palmerston, n’est-ce pas?</span></i> But that is
always the way; ministers are always
the same. You will hardly credit it,
my dear friend, but I—I with my ancient
title—and the most popular
author of France, am not even a
member of the Chamber of Deputies!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You amaze me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—after all, you manage better
in England. There is that little D’Israeli—very
clever man—Monceton
Milles, Bourring, <i><span lang="fr">bien mauvais poètes</span></i>,
and Wakeley, all in the legislature;
while here the literary interest is altogether
unrepresented.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely, my dear Marquis, you forget—there’s
Lamartine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lamartine! a mere sentimentalist—a
nobody! No, my dear friend;
France must be regenerated. The
daughter of glory, she cannot live
without progression.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How, Marquis? I thought that
you and Montpensier”—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were friends! True enough. It
was I who settled the Spanish marriages.
There, I rather flatter myself,
I had your perfidious Albion on the
hip. But, to say the truth, I am tired
of family alliances. We want something
more to keep us alive—something
startling, in short—something
like the Pyramids and Moscow, to give
us an impulse forward into the dark
gulf of futurity. The limits of Algeria
are too contracted for the fluttering of
our national banner. We want freedom,
less taxation, and a more extended
frontier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And cannot all these,” said
I, unwilling to lose the opportunity
of converting so remarkable man as
the Count of Monte-Christo to
the grand principles of Manchester—“Cannot
these be attained by more
peaceful methods than the subversion
of general tranquillity? What is freedom,
my dear Marquis, but an unlimited
exportation of cotton abroad,
with double task hours of wholesome
labour at home? How will you diminish
your taxation better, than by
reducing all duties on imports, until
the deficit is laid directly upon the
shoulders of a single uncomplaining
class? Why seek to extend your
frontier, whilst we in England, out of
sheer love to the world at large, are
rapidly demolishing our colonies? Did
you ever happen,” continued I, pulling
from my pocket a bundle of the Manchester
manifestos, “to peruse any of
these glorious epitomes of reason and
of political science? Are you familiar
with the soul-stirring tracts of Thompson
and of Bright? Did you ever read
the Socialist’s scheme for universal
philanthropy, which Cobden”—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Peste!</span></i>” replied the illustrious
nobleman, “what the deuce do we care
for the opinions of Monsieur Tonson,
or any of your low manufacturers? By
my honour, Dunshunner, I am afraid
you are losing your head. Don’t you
know, my dear fellow, that all great
revolutions spring from us, the men
of genius? It is we who are the true
rousers of the people; we, the poets
and romancers, who are the source of
all legitimate power. Witness Voltaire,
Rousseau, De Beranger, and—I may
say it without any imputation of vanity—the
Marquis Davy de la Pailleterie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yours is a new theory!” said I,
musingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“New! Pray pardon me—it is as
old as literature itself! No revolution
can be effectual unless it has the fine
arts for its basis. Simple as I stand here,
I demand no more time than a month
to wrap Europe in universal war.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t say so seriously?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On my honour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me leave to doubt it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Should you like a proof?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not on so great a scale, certainly.
I am afraid the results would be too
serious to justify the experiment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, bah! You are a philanthropist.
What are a few thousand lives
compared with the triumph of mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much to you, perhaps, but
certainly something to the owners.
But come, my dear friend, you are
jesting. You don’t mean to insinuate
that you possess any such power?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the means? Granting that
you have the power—and all Europe
acknowledges the extraordinary faculties
of the author of Monte-Christo—some
time would be required for their
development. You cannot hope to
inoculate the mind of a nation in a
moment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not say a moment—I said
a month.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And dare I ask your recipe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A very simple one. Two romances,
each in ten volumes, and a
couple of melodramas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! of your own?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of mine,” replied the Marquis de
la Pailleterie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish to heaven that I knew how
you set about it. I have heard G. P.
R. James backed for a volume a month,
but this sinks him into utter insignificance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no difficulty in explaining
it. He writes,—I never do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You never write?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then how the mischief do you
manage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I compose. Since I met you, I
have composed and dictated a whole
chapter of the Memoirs of a Physician.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dictated?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure. It is already written
down, and will be circulated throughout
Paris to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Monsieur le Marquis—have I the
honour to hold an interview with
Satan?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Mon cher, vous me flattez beaucoup!</span></i>
I have not thought it necessary to
intrust my experiences to the sympathising
bosom of M. Frédéric
Soulié.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you a familiar spirit, then?”
said I, casting a suspicious glance towards
the poodle, then vigorously
engaged in hunting through its woolly
fleece.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Marquis smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ingenuity of your supposition,
my dear friend, deserves a specific
answer. I have indeed a familiar spirit—that
is, I am possessed of a confidant,
ready at all times, though absent, to
chronicle my thoughts, and to express,
in corresponding words, the
spontaneous emotions of my soul.
Nay, you need not start. The art is
an innocent one, and its practice,
though divulged, would not expose
me in any way to the censures of the
church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You pique my curiosity strangely!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, listen. For some
years I have paid the utmost attention
to the science of animal magnetism,
an art which undoubtedly lay at
the foundation of the ancient Chaldean
lore, and which, though now revived,
has been debased by the artifices and
quackery of knaves. I need not go
into details. After long search, I
have succeeded in finding a being
which, in its dormant or spiritual
state, has an entire affinity with my
own. When awake, you would suppose
Leontine Deschappelles to be a
mere ordinary though rather interesting
female, endowed certainly with a
miraculous sensibility for music, but
not otherwise in any way remarkable.
But, when asleep, she becomes as it
were the counterpart or reflex of myself.
Every thought which passes
through my bosom simultaneously
arises in hers. I do not need even to
utter the words. By some miraculous
process, these present themselves as
vividly to her as if I had bestowed the
utmost labour upon composition. I
have but to throw her into a magnetic
sleep, and my literary product for the
day is secured. I go forth through
Paris, mingle in society, appear idle
and <em>insouciant</em>; and yet all the while
the ideal personages of my tale are
passing over the mirror of my mind,
and performing their allotted duty.
I have reached such perfection in the
art, that I can compose two or even
three romances at once. I return
towards evening, and then I find
Leontine, pale indeed and exhausted,
but with a vast pile of manuscript
before her, which contains the faithful
transcript of my thoughts. Now, perhaps,
you will cease to wonder at an
apparent fertility, which, I am aware,
has challenged the admiration and
astonishment of Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All this was uttered by Monte-Christo
with such exemplary gravity,
that I stood perfectly confounded. If
true, it was indeed the solution of the
greatest literary problem of the age;
but I could hardly suppress the idea
that he was making me the victim of a
hoax.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And whereabouts does she dwell,
this Demoiselle Leontine?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At my house,” he replied: “she
is my adopted child. Poor Leontine!
sometimes when I look at her wasted
cheek, I feel a pang of regret to think
that she is paying so dear for a celebrity
which must be immortal. But
it is the fate of genius, my friend, and
all of us must submit!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the Marquis uttered this sentiment
with a pathetic sigh, I could not
refrain from glancing at his manly
and athletic proportions. Certainly
there was no appearance of over-fatigue
or lassitude there. He looked
the very incarnation of good cheer,
and had contrived to avert from his
own person all vestige of those calamities
which he was pleased so feelingly
to deplore. He might have
been exhibited at the <i><span lang="fr">Frères Provençaux</span></i>
as a splendid result of their nutritive
and culinary system.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You doubt me still, I see,” said
De la Pailleterie. “Well, I cannot
wonder at it. Such things, I know,
sound strange in the apprehension of
you incredulous islanders. But I
will even give you a proof, Dunshunner,
which is more than I would do
to any other man—for I cannot forget
the service you rendered me long ago
at the Isle de Bourbon. You see
this little instrument,—put it to your
ear. I shall summon Leontine to
speak, and the sound of her reply will
be conveyed to you through that silver
tube, which is in strict <em>rapport</em> with
her magnetic constitution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, he placed in my hand a
miniature silver trumpet, beautifully
wrought, which I immediately placed
to my ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Monte-Christo drew himself up to
his full height, fixed his fine eyes
earnestly upon vacuity, made several
passes upwards with his hand, and
then said,</p>

<p class='c009'>“My friend, do you hear me? If
so, answer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately, and to my unexpected
surprise, there thrilled through
the silver tube a whisper of miraculous
sweetness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great master! I listen—I obey!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May St Mungo, St Mirren, St
Rollox, and all the other western
saints, have me in their keeping!”
cried I. “Heard ever mortal man
aught like this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush—be silent!” said the Marquis,
“or you may destroy the spell.
Leontine, have you concluded the
chapter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have,” said the voice: “shall
I read the last sentences?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do,” replied the adept, who
seemed to hear the response simultaneously
with myself, by intuition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The voice went on. “At this
moment the door of the apartment
opened, and Chon rushed into the
room. ‘Well, my little sister, how
goes it?’ said the Countess. ‘Bad.’
‘Indeed!’ ‘It is but too true.’ ‘De
Noailles?’ ‘No.’ ‘Ha! D’Aiguillon?’
‘You deceive yourself.’ ‘Who
then?’ ‘Philip de Taverney, the
Chevalier Maison-Rouge!’ ‘Ha!’
cried the Countess, ‘then I am lost!’
and she sank senseless upon the
cushions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well done, Leontine!” exclaimed
De la Pailleterie; “that is the seventh
chapter I have composed since
morning. Are you fatigued, my
child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very—very weary,” replied the
voice, in a melancholy cadence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall have rest soon. Come
hither. Do you see me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! you are very cruel!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand. Cease to be fatigued—I
will it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! thanks, thanks!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you see me now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do. Oh, how handsome!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Marquis caressed his whiskers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where am I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the corner of the Place de la
Concorde, near the Tuilleries’ gardens.
Ah, you naughty man, you have been
smoking!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A poodle-dog,” replied the voice.
“What a pretty creature! he is just
snapping at a fly. Come here, poor
fellow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The poodle gave an unearthly yell,
and rushed between the legs of Monte-Christo,
thereby nearly capsizing that
extraordinary magician.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who else?” asked the Marquis.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A tall man, with sandy-coloured
hair. La, how funny!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am laughing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At his dress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is he dressed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a blue coat with gilt buttons,
a white hat, and such odd scarlet-and-yellow
trowsers!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I stood petrified. It was quite
true. In a moment of abstraction I
had that morning donned a pair of
integuments of the M’Tavish tartan,
and my legs were of the colour of the
flamingo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he handsome?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not exactly catch the response.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will do, my dear Marquis,”
said I, returning him the trumpet. “I
am now perfectly convinced of the
truth of your assertions, and can no
longer wonder at the marvellous fertility
of your pen—I beg pardon—of
your invention. Pray, do not trouble
your fair friend any further upon my
account. I have heard quite enough
to satisfy me that I am in the presence
of the most remarkable man in
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pooh! this is a mere bagatelle.
Any man might do the same, with a
slight smattering of the occult sciences.
But we were talking, if I recollect
right, about moral influence and
power. I maintain that the authors
of romance and melodrama are the
true masters of the age: you, on the
contrary, believe in free-trade and
the jargon of political economy. Is
it not so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True. We started from that
point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, would you like to see
a revolution?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not on my account, my dear
Marquis. I own the interest of the
spectacle, but it demands too great a
sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. In fact, I have made
up my mind for a <em>bouleversement</em> this
spring, as I seriously believe it would
tend very much to the respectability
of France. It must come sooner or
later. Louis Philippe is well up in
years, and it cannot make much difference
to him. Besides, I am tired
of Guizot. He gives himself airs as
an historian which are absolutely insufferable,
and France can submit to
it no longer. The only doubt I entertain
is, whether this ought to be a
new ministry, or an entire dynastical
change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are the best judge. For my
own part, having no interest in the
matter further than curiosity, a change
of ministers would satisfy me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, but there are considerations
beyond that. Much may be said upon
both sides. There is danger certainly
in organic changes, at the same time
we must work out by all means our
full and legitimate freedom. What
would you do in such a case of perplexity?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Victor Hugo’s simple and romantic
method of deciding between hostile
opinions, as exemplified in his valuable
drama of Lucrèce Borgia, at once
occurred to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you quite serious,” said I,
“in wishing to effect a change of
some kind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am,” said the Marquis, “as
resolute as Prometheus on the Caucasus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, suppose we toss for it; and
so leave the question of a new cabinet
or dynasty entirely to the arbitration
of fate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good and a pious idea!” replied
the Marquis de la Pailleterie.
“Here is a five-franc piece. I shall
toss, and you shall call.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Up went the dollar, big with the
fate of France, twirling in the evening
air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heads for a new ministry!”
cried I, and the coin fell chinking on
the gravel. We both rushed up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is tails!” said the Marquis
devoutly. “Destiny! thou hast willed
it, and I am but thine instrument.
Farewell, my friend; in ten days you
shall hear more of this. Meantime,
I must be busy. Poor Leontine!
thou hast a heavy task before thee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you are going homewards,”
said I, “permit me to accompany you
so far. Our way lies together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so,” replied the Marquis
thoughtfully. “I dine to-day at
Véfour’s, and in the evening I must
attend the Théatre de la Porte St
Martin. I am never so much alone
as in the midst of excitement. O
France, France! what do I not endure
for thee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, Monte-Christo extended
his hand, which I wrung affectionately
within my own. I felt proud of the
link which bound me to so high and
elevated a being.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, my friend!” said I, “ah,
my friend! there is yet time to
pause.  Would it not be wiser and
better to forego this enterprise
altogether?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You forget,” replied the other
solemnly. “Destiny has willed it.
Go, let us each fulfil our destiny!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, this remarkable man
tucked the poodle under his arm, and
in a few moments was lost to my
view amidst the avenues of the garden
of the Tuilleries.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER II.<br> THE IDES OF MARCH.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Several days elapsed, during which
Paris maintained its customary tranquillity.
The eye of a stranger could
have observed very little alteration in
the demeanour of the populace; and
even in the <em>salons</em>, there was no strong
surmise of any coming event of importance.
In the capital of France
one looks for a revolution as quietly
as the people of England await the
advent of “the coming man.” The
event is always prophesied—sometimes
apparently upon the eve of
being fulfilled; but the failures are so
numerous as to prevent inordinate
disappointment. In the Chamber
there were some growlings about the
Reform banquet, and the usual vague
threats if any attempt should be made
to coerce the liberties of the people;
but these demonstrations had been so
often repeated, that nobody had faith
in any serious or critical result.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little Thiers, to be sure, blustered;
and Odillon Barrot assumed pompous
airs, and tried to look like a Roman
citizen, at our small patriotic cosmopolitan
reunions; but I never could believe
that either of them was thoroughly
in earnest. We all know the game that
is played in Britain, where the doors
of the ministerial cabinet are constructed
on the principle of a Dutch
clock. When it is fair weather, the
ambitious figure of Lord John Russell
is seen mounting guard on the outside—when
it threatens to blow, the small
sentry retires, and makes way for the
Tamworth grenadier. Just so was it
in Paris. Guizot, if wheeled from his
perch, was expected to be replaced
by the smarter and more enterprising
Thiers, and slumbrous Duchatel by
the broad-chested and beetle-browed
Barrot.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time, I could not
altogether shut my eyes to the more
active state of the press. I do not
mean to aver that the mere political
articles exhibited more than their
usual vigour; but throughout the whole
literature of the day there ran an under-current
of revolutionary feeling
which betokened wonderful unanimity.
Less than usual was said about Marengo,
Austerlitz, or even the three
glorious days of July. The minds of
men were directed further back, to a
period when the Republic was all in
all, when France stood isolated among
the nations, great in crime, and
drunken with her new-won freedom.
The lapse of half a century is enough
to throw a sort of halo around the
memory of the veriest villain and assassin.
We have seen Dick Turpin
and Jack Sheppard exhumed from
their graves to be made the heroes of
modern romance; and the same alchemy
was now applied to the honoured
ashes of Anacharsis Clootz, and other
patriots of the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this was done very insidiously,
and, I must say, with consummate
skill. Six or seven simultaneous romances
reminded the public of its
former immunity from rule, and about
as many melodramas denounced utter
perdition to tyranny. I liked the fun.
Man is by nature a revolutionary animal,
especially when he has nothing
to lose; and it is needless to remark
that a very small portion indeed of
my capital was invested in the foreign
funds.</p>

<p class='c009'>I saw little of my friend the Marquis,
beyond meeting him at the usual
promenades, and bowing to him at
the theatres, where he never failed to
present himself. A casual observer
would have thought that De la Pailleterie
had no other earthly vocation
than to perambulate Paris as a mere
votary of pleasure. Once or twice,
however, towards evening, I encountered
him in his uniform of the National
Guard, with fire in his eye,
haste in his step, and a settled deliberation
on his forehead; and I could
not help, as I gazed upon him, feeling
transported backwards to the period
of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length I received the expected
billet, and on the appointed evening
rendered myself punctually at his
house. The rooms were already more
than half filled by the company.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are the Ides of March come?”
said I, pressing the proffered hand of
Monte-Christo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come—but not yet over,” he replied.
“You have seen the new play
which has produced such a marked
sensation?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have. Wonderful production!
Whose is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A mysterious smile played upon the
lip of my friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come,” said he, “let me introduce
you to a countryman, a sympathiser;
one who, like you, is desirous
that our poor country should participate
in the blessings of the British
loom. Mr Hutton Bagsby—Mr Dunshunner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bagsby was a punchy man, with a
bald head, and a nose which betokened
his habitual addiction to the fiery
grape of Portugal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Servant, sir!” said he. “Understand
you’re a free-trader, supporter
of Cobden’s principles, and inclined to
go the whole hog. Glad to see a
man of common understanding here.
Damme, sir, when I speak to these
French fellows about calico, they
begin to talk about fraternity; which,
as I take it, means eating frogs, for I
don’t pretend to understand their outlandish
gibberish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every nation has its hobby, you
know, Mr Bagsby,” I replied. “We
consider ourselves more practical than
the French, and stick to the main
chance; they, on the other hand, are
occupied with social grievances, and
what they call the rights of labour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rights of labour!” exclaimed
Bagsby. “Hanged if I think labour
has got any rights at all. Blow all
protection! say I. Look after the
interests of the middle classes, and
let capital have its swing. As for
those confounded working fellows,
who cares about them? We don’t,
I can answer for it. When I was in
the League, we wanted to bring corn
down, in order to get work cheaper;
and, now that we’ve got it, do you
think we will stand any rubbish
about rights? These French fellows
are a poor set; they don’t understand
sound commercial principles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha! Lamoricière!” said our host,
accosting a general officer who just then
entered the apartment; “how goes
it? Any result from to-day’s demonstration
at the Chamber?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Ma foi!</span></i> I should say there is.
The banquets are forbidden. There
is a talk about impeaching ministers;
and, in the meantime, the artillery-waggons
are rumbling through the
streets in scores.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then our old friend Macaire is
likely to make a stand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is quite possible that the respectable
gentleman may try it,” said
the commandant, regaling himself
with a pinch. “By the way, the
National Guard must turn out to-morrow
early. The <em>rappel</em> will be
beat by daybreak. There is a stir
already in the Boulevards; and, as I
drove here, I saw the people in thousands
reading the evening journals by
torch-light.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such is liberty!” exclaimed a
little gentleman, who had been listening
eagerly to the General. “Such
is liberty! she holds her bivouac at
nightfall by the torch of reason; and,
on the morrow, the dawn is red with
the brightness of the sun of Austerlitz!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A loud hum of applause followed
the enunciation of this touching sentiment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our friend is great to-night,”
whispered Monte-Christo; “and he
may be greater to-morrow. If Louis
Philippe yields, he may be prime minister—if
firing begins, I have a shrewd
notion he won’t be any where. Ah,
Monsieur Albert! welcome from
Cannes. We have been expecting
you for some time, and you have
arrived not a moment too soon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The individual thus accosted was
of middle height, advanced age, and
very plainly dressed. He wore a
rusty gray surtout, trousers of plaid
check, and the lower part of his countenance
was buried in the folds of a
black cravat. The features were remarkable;
and, somehow or other,
I thought that I had seen them before.
The small gray eyes rolled restlessly
beneath their shaggy pent-house;
the cheek-bones were remarkably
prominent; a deep furrow was cut on
either side of the mouth; and the
nose, which was of singular conformation,
seemed endowed with spontaneous
life, and performed a series
of extraordinary mechanical revolutions.
Altogether, the appearance of
the man impressed me with the idea
of strong, ill-regulated energy, and
of that restless activity which is emphatically
the mother of mischief.</p>

<p class='c009'>Monsieur Albert did not seem very
desirous of courting attention. He
rather winked than replied to our
host, threw a suspicious look at Bagsby,
who was staring him in the face,
honoured me with a survey, and then
edged away into the crowd. I felt
rather curious to know something
more about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, my dear Marquis,” said I,
“who may this Monsieur Albert
be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Albert! Is it possible that you
do not—but I forget. I can only tell
you, <i><span lang="fr">mon cher</span></i>, that this Monsieur
Albert is a very remarkable man, and
will be heard of hereafter among the
ranks of the people. You seem to
suspect a mystery? Well, well!
There are mysteries in all great
dramas, such as that which is now
going on around us; so, for the present,
you must be content to know
my friend as simple Albert, <em>ouvrier</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hanged if I haven’t seen that
fellow in the black choker before!”
said Mr Bagsby; “or, at all events,
I’ve seen his double. I say, Mr
Dunshunner, who is the chap that
came in just now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really cannot tell, Mr Bagsby.
Monte-Christo calls him simply Mr
Albert, a workman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s their fraternity, I suppose!
If I thought he was an operative,
I’d be off in the twinkling of a billy-roller.
But it’s all a hoax. Do you
know, I think he’s very like a certain
noble—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here an aide-de-camp, booted and
spurred, dashed into the apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“General! you are wanted immediately:
the <i><span lang="fr">émeute</span></i> has begun, half
Paris is rushing to arms, and they
are singing the Marseillaise through
the streets!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any thing else?” said the
General, who, with inimitable <i><span lang="fr">sang
froid</span></i>, was sipping a tumbler of
orgeat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guizot has resigned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bravo!” cried the little gentleman
above referred to—and he cut a caper
that might have done credit to Vestris.
“Bravo! there is some chance for
capable men now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was told,” continued the aide-de-camp,
“as I came along, that
Count Molé had been sent for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Molé! bah! an imbecile!” muttered
the diminutive statesman. “It
was not worth a revolution to produce
such a miserable result.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what say the people?” asked
our host.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Cela ne suffira pas!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Ah, les bons citoyens! Ah, les
braves garçons! Je les connais!</span></i>” And
here the candidate for office executed
a playful pirouette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nevertheless,” said Lamoricière,
“we must do our duty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which is?” interrupted De la
Pailleterie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To see the play played out, at all
events,” replied the military patriot;
“and therefore, messieurs, I have the
honour to wish you all a very good
evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But stop, General,” cried two or
three voices: “what would you advise
us to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the first place, gentlemen,”
replied the warrior, and his words
were listened to with the deepest attention,
“I would recommend you,
as the streets are in a disturbed state,
to see the ladies home. That duty
performed, you will probably be
guided by your own sagacity and
tastes. The National Guard will, of
course, muster at their quarters.
Gentlemen who are of an architectural
genius will probably be gratified by
an opportunity of inspecting several
barricades in different parts of the
city; and I have always observed,
that behind a wall of this description,
there is little danger from a passing
bullet. Others, who are fond of fireworks,
may possibly find an opportunity
of improving themselves in the
pyrotechnic art. But I detain you,
gentlemen, I fear unjustifiably; and
as I observe that the firing has begun,
I have the honour once more to
renew my salutations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And in fact a sharp fusillade was
heard without, towards the conclusion
of the General’s harangue. The whole
party was thrown into confusion;
several ladies showed symptoms of
fainting, and were incontinently received
in the arms of their respective
cavaliers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The aspiring statesman had disappeared.
Whether he got under a
sofa, or up the chimney, I do not
know, but he vanished utterly from
my eyes. Monte-Christo was in a
prodigious state of excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have kept my word, you see,”
he said: “this may be misconstrued
in history, but I call upon you to bear
witness that the revolution was a triumph
of genius. O France!” continued
he, filling his pocket with
macaroons, “the hour of thine emancipation
has come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Observing a middle-aged lady making
towards the door without male
escort, I thought it incumbent upon
me to tender my services, in compliance
with the suggestions of the gallant
Lamoricière. I was a good deal
obstructed, however, by Mr Hutton
Bagsby, who, in extreme alarm, was
cleaving to the skirts of my garments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I be of the slightest assistance
in offering my escort to madame?”
said I with a respectful bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lady looked at me with unfeigned
surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Monsieur mistakes, I believe,”
said she quietly. “Perhaps he thinks
I carry a fan. Look here”—and she
exhibited the butt of an enormous
horse-pistol. “The authoress of
Lélia knows well how to command
respect for herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George Sand!” I exclaimed in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same, monsieur; who will
be happy to meet you this evening at
an early hour, behind the barricade of
the Rue Montmartre.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O good Lord!” cried Mr Hutton
Bagsby, “here is a precious kettle of
fish! They are firing out yonder like
mad; they’ll be breaking into the
houses next, and we’ll all be murdered
to a man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not be alarmed, Mr Bagsby;
this is a mere political revolution. The
people have no animosity whatever to
strangers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t they? I wish you had
seen the way the waiter looked this
morning at my dressing case. They’d
tie me up to the lamp-post at once for
the sake of my watch and seals! And
I don’t know a single word of their
bloody language. I wish the leaders
of the League had been hanged before
they sent me here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! then you are here upon a
mission?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’m a delegate, as they call
it. O Lord, I wish somebody would
take me home!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where do you reside, Mr
Bagsby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know the name of the
street, and the man who brought me
here has just gone away with a gun!
Oh dear! what shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I really felt considerably embarrassed.
By this time Monte-Christo
and most of his guests had departed,
and I knew no one to whom I could
consign the unfortunate and terrified
free-trader. I sincerely pitied poor
Bagsby, who was eminently unfitted
for this sort of work; and was just
about to offer him an asylum in my
own apartments, when I felt my
shoulder touched, and, turning round,
recognised the intelligent though sarcastic
features of Albert the ouvrier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are both English?” he said
in a perfectly pure dialect. “<i><span lang="fr">Eh
bien</span></i>, I like the English, and I wish
they understood us better. You are
in difficulties. Well, I will assist.
Come with me. You may depend
upon the honour of a member of the
Institute. Workman as I am, I have
some influence here. Come—is it a
bargain? Only one caution, gentlemen:
remember where you are, and
that the watchwords for the night are
<i><span lang="fr">fraternité</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">égalité</span></i>! You comprehend?
Let us lose no time, but follow me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, he strode to the door.
Bagsby said not a word, but
clutched my arm. But as we descended
the staircase, he muttered in
my ear as well as the chittering of his
teeth would allow:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is <em>him</em>—I am perfectly certain!
Who on earth would have believed
this! O Lord Harry!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER III.<br> THE BARRICADES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The streets were in a state of wild
commotion. Every where we encountered
crowds of truculent working
fellows, dressed in blouses and armed
with muskets, who were pressing towards
the Boulevards. Sometimes
they passed us in hurried groups; at
other times the way was intercepted
by a regular procession bearing
torches, and singing the war-hymn of
Marseilles. Those who judge of the
physical powers of the French people
by the specimens they usually encounter
in the streets of Paris, are
certain to form an erroneous estimate.
A more powerful and athletic race
than the workmen is scarcely to be
found in Europe; and it was not, I
confess, without a certain sensation
of terror, that I found myself launched
into the midst of this wild and uncontrollable
mob, whose furious gestures
testified to their excitement, and
whose brawny arms were bared, and
ready for the work of slaughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Considering the immense military
force which was known to be stationed
in and around Paris, it seemed to me
quite miraculous that no effective demonstration
had been made. Possibly
the troops might be drawn up
in some of the wider streets or squares,
but hitherto we had encountered none.
Several bodies of the National Guard,
it is true, occasionally went by; but
these did not seem to be considered
as part of the military force, nor did
they take any active steps towards the
quelling of the disturbance. At times,
however, the sound of distant firing
warned us that the struggle had
begun.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Bagsby clung to my arm in
a perfect paroxysm of fear. I had
cautioned him, as we went out, on no
account to open his lips, or to make
any remarks which might serve to
betray his origin. The creature was
quite docile, and followed in the footsteps
of Monsieur Albert like a lamb.
That mysterious personage strode
boldly forward, chuckling to himself
as he went, and certainly exhibited
a profound knowledge of the topography
of Paris. Once or twice we
were stopped and questioned; but a
few cabalistic words from our leader
solved all difficulties, and we were
allowed to proceed amidst general
and vociferous applause.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length, as we approached the
termination of a long and narrow
street, we heard a tremendous shouting,
and the unmistakable sounds of
conflict.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here come the Municipal Guards!”
cried M. Albert, quickly. “These
fellows fight like demons, and have no
regard for the persons of the people.
Follow me, gentlemen, this way, and
speedily, if you do not wish to be
sliced like blanc-mange!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words the ouvrier dived
into a dark lane, and we lost no time
in following his example. I had no
idea whatever of our locality, but it
seemed evident that we were in one
of the worst quarters of Paris. Every
lamp in the lane had been broken, so
that we could form no opinion of its
character from vision. It was, however,
ankle-deep of mud—a circumstance
by no means likely to prolong
the existence of my glazed boots.
Altogether, I did not like the situation;
and, had it not been for the
guarantee as to M. Albert’s respectability,
implied from his acquaintance
with Monte-Christo, I think I should
have preferred trusting myself to the
tender mercies of the Municipal
Guard. As for poor Bagsby, his
teeth were going like castanets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You seem cold, sir,” said Albert,
in a deep and husky voice, as we
reached a part of the lane apparently
fenced in by dead walls. “This is a
wild night for a Manchester weaver
to be wandering in the streets of
Paris!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Lord! you know me, then?”
groaned Bagsby, with a piteous accent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Know you? ha, ha!” replied the
other, with the laugh of the third ruffian
in a melodrama; “who does not
know citizen Bagsby, the delegate—Bagsby,
the great champion of the
League—Bagsby, the millionnaire!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not true, upon my soul!”
cried Bagsby; “I am nothing of the
kind. I haven’t a hundred pounds in
the world that I can properly call my
own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The world wrongs you, then,”
said Albert; “and, to say the truth,
you keep up the delusion by carrying
so much bullion about you. I should
say, now, that the chain round your
neck must be worth some fifty louis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bagsby made no reply, but clutched
my arm with the grasp of a cockatoo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a very dreary place,”
continued Albert, in a tone that
might have emanated from a sepulchre.
“Last winter, three men were
robbed and murdered in this very
passage. There is a conduit to the
Seine below, and I saw the bodies
next morning in the Morgue, with
their throats cut from ear to ear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>From a slight interjectional sound,
I concluded that Bagsby was praying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These,” said the ouvrier, “are
the walls of a slaughter-house: on
the other side is the shed where they
ordinarily keep the guillotine. Have
you seen that implement yet, Mr
Bagsby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercy on us, no!” groaned the
delegate. “Oh, Mr Albert, whoever
you are, do take us out of this place,
or I am sure I shall lose my reason!
If you want my watch, say so at
once, and, upon my word, you are
heartily welcome.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harkye, sirrah,” said Monsieur
Albert: “I have more than half a
mind to leave you here all night for
your consummate impertinence. I
knew you from the very first to be a
thorough poltroon; but I shall find a
proper means of chastising you.
Come along, sir; we are past the
lane now, and at a place where your
hands may be better employed for the
liberties of the people than your head
ever was in inventing task-work at
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We now emerged into an open
court, lighted by a solitary lamp. It
was apparently deserted, but, on a
low whistle from Monsieur Albert,
some twenty or thirty individuals in
blouses rushed forth from the doorways
and surrounded us. I own I
did not feel remarkably comfortable
at the moment; for although it was
clear to me that our guide had merely
been amusing himself at the expense of
Bagsby, the apparition of his confederates
was rather sudden and startling.
As for Bagsby, he evidently expected
no better fate than an immediate conduct
to the block.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You come late, <i><span lang="fr">mon capitaine</span></i>,”
said a bloused veteran, armed with a
mattock. “They have the start of
us already in the Rue des Petits
Champs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, <i><span lang="fr">grognard</span></i>! we are
early enough for the ball,” said M.
Albert. “Have you every thing
ready as I desired?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All ready—spades, levers, pickaxes,
and the rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Arms?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Enough to serve our purpose,
and we shall soon have more. But
who are these with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fraternisers—two bold Englishmen,
who are ready to die for freedom!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Vivent les Anglais, et à bas les
tyrans!</span></i>” shouted the blouses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This citizen,” continued Albert,
indicating the unhappy Bagsby, “is
a Cobdenist and a delegate. He has
sworn to remain at the barricades
until the last shot is fired, and to
plant the red banner of the emancipated
people upon its summit. His
soul is thirsting for fraternity. Brothers!
open to him your arms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hereupon a regular scramble took
place for the carcass of Mr Hutton
Bagsby. Never surely was so much
love lavished upon any human creature.
Patriot after patriot bestowed
on him the full-flavoured hug of fraternity,
and he emerged from their
grasp very much in the tattered condition
of a scarecrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give the citizen delegate a blouse
and a pickaxe,” quoth Albert, “and
then for the barricade. You have
your orders—execute them. Up with
the pavement, down with the trees;
fling over every omnibus and cab that
comes in your way, and fight to the
last drop of your blood for France
and her freedom. Away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a tremendous shout the patriots
rushed off, hurrying Bagsby
along with them. The unfortunate
man offered no resistance, but the
agony depicted on his face might
have melted the heart of a millstone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Albert remained silent until the
group were out of sight, and then
burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That little man,” said he, “will
gather some useful experiences to-night
that may last him as long as he
lives. As for you, Mr Dunshunner,
whose name and person are well
known to me, I presume you have
no ambition to engage in any such
architectural constructions?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I modestly acknowledged my aversion
to practical masonry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then,” said the ouvrier, “I
suppose you are perfectly competent
to take care of yourself. There will
be good fun in the streets, if you
choose to run the risk of seeing it; at
the same time there is safety in stone
walls. ’Gad, I think this will astonish
plain John! There’s nothing like
it in his <cite>Lives of the Chancellors</cite>. I
don’t want, however, to see our friend
the delegate absolutely sacrificed.
Will you do me the favour to inquire
for him to-morrow at the barricade
down there? I will answer for it that
he does not make his escape before
then; and now for Ledru Rollin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words, and a friendly
nod, the eccentric artisan departed,
at a pace which showed how little his
activity had been impaired by years.
Filled with painful and conflicting
thoughts, I followed the course of
another street which led me to the
Rue Rivoli.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here I had a capital opportunity
of witnessing the progress of the
revolution. The street was crowded
with the people shouting, yelling, and
huzzaing; and a large body of the
National Guard, drawn up immediately
in front of me, seemed to be in
high favour. Indeed, I was not surprised
at this, on discovering that the
officer in command was no less a person
than my illustrious friend De la
Pailleterie. He looked as warlike as a
Lybian lion, though it was impossible
to comprehend what particular section
of the community were the objects of
his sublime anger. Indeed, it was
rather difficult to know what the gentlemen
in blouses wanted. Some
were shouting for reform, as if that
were a tangible article which could be
handed them from a window; others
demanded the abdication of ministers—rather
unreasonably I thought,
since at that moment there was no
vestige of a ministry in France;
whilst the most practical section of
the mob was clamorous for the head
of Guizot. Presently the shakos and
bright bayonets of a large detachment
of infantry were seen approaching,
amidst vehement cries of “Vive
la Ligne!” They marched up to the
National Guard, who still maintained
their ranks. The leading officer looked
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are these?” he said, pointing
with his sword to the Guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have the honour to inform
Monsieur,” said Monte-Christo, stepping
forward, “that these are the
second legion of the National Guard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vive la Garde Nationale!” cried
the officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vive la Ligne!” reciprocated the
Marquis.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both gentlemen then saluted, and
interchanged snuff-boxes, amidst tremendous
cheering from the populace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who are these?” continued
the officer, pointing to the blouses on
the pavement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These are the people,” replied
Monte-Christo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They must disperse. My orders
are peremptory,” said the regular.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The National Guard will protect
them. Monsieur, respect the people!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They must disperse,” repeated the
officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They shall not,” replied Monte-Christo.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment was critical.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case,” replied the officer,
after a pause, “I shall best fulfil my
duty by wishing Monsieur a good
evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are a brave fellow!” cried
the Marquis, sheathing his sabre;
and in a moment the warriors were
locked in a brotherly embrace.</p>

<p class='c009'>The effect was electric and instantaneous.
“Let us all fraternise!”
was the cry; and regulars, nationals,
and blouses, rushed into each others’
arms. The union was complete. Jacob
and Esau coalesced without the formality
of an explanation. Ammunition
was handed over by the troops
without the slightest scruple, and in
return many bottles of <i><span lang="fr">vin ordinaire</span></i>
were produced for the refreshment of
the military. No man who witnessed
that scene could have any doubt as to
the final result of the movement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently, however, a smart fusillade
was heard to the right. The cry
arose, “They are assassinating the
people! to the barricades! to the
barricades!” and the whole multitude
swept vehemently forward towards
the place of contest. Unfortunately,
in my anxiety to behold the
rencontre in which my friend bore so
distinguished a part, I had pressed a
little further forwards than was prudent,
and I now found myself in the
midst of an infuriated gang of workmen,
and urged irresistibly onwards
to the nearest barricade.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thou hast no arms, comrade!”
cried a gigantic butcher, who strode beside
me armed with an enormous axe;
“here—take this;” and he thrust a
sabre into my hand; “take this, and
strike home for <i><span lang="fr">la Patrie</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I muttered my acknowledgments
for the gift, and tried to look as like
a patriot as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Tête de Robespierre!</span></i>” cried
another. “This is better than paying
taxes! <i><span lang="fr">A bas la Garde Municipale!
à bas tous les tyrans!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Tête de Brissot!</span></i>” exclaimed I, in
return, thinking it no unwise plan to
invoke the Manes of some of the earlier
heroes. This was a slight mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Quoi? Girondin?</span></i>” cried the
butcher, with a ferocious scowl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Non; corps de Marat!</span></i>” I
shouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Bon! embrassez-moi donc, camarade!</span></i>”
said the butcher, and so we
reached the barricade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the game was going on in
earnest. The barricade had been
thrown up hastily and imperfectly,
and a considerable body of the Municipal
Guard—who, by the way, behaved
throughout with much intrepidity—was
attempting to dislodge the rioters. In
fact, they had almost succeeded. Some
ten of the insurgents, who were perched
upon the top of the pile, had been
shot down, and no one seemed anxious
to supply their place on that bad eminence.
In vain my friend the butcher
waved his axe, and shouted “<i><span lang="fr">En
avant!</span></i>” A considerable number of
voices, indeed, took up the cry, but a
remarkable reluctance was exhibited
in setting the salutary example. A
few minutes more, and the passage
would have been cleared; when all of
a sudden, from the interior of a cabriolet,
which formed a sort of parapet to
the embankment, emerged a ghastly
figure, streaming with gore, and
grasping the <i><span lang="fr">drapeau rouge</span></i>. I never
was more petrified in my life—there
could be no doubt of the man—it was
Hutton Bagsby!</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment he stood gazing upon
the tossing multitude beneath. There
was a brief pause, and even the soldiers,
awed by his intrepidity, forebore
to fire. At last, however, they
raised their muskets; when, with a
hoarse scream, Bagsby leaped from
the barricade, and alighted uninjured
on the street. Had Mars descended
in person to lead the insurrection, he
could not have done better.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Ah, le brave Anglais! Ah, le député
intrépide! A la rescousse!</span></i>”<a id='t497'></a> was
the cry, and a torrent of human beings
rushed headlong over the barricade.</p>

<p class='c009'>No power on earth could have resisted
that terrific charge. The Municipal
Guards were scattered like chaff
before the wind; some were cut down,
and others escaped under cover of the
ranks of the Nationals. Like the rest,
I had leaped the embankment; but
not being anxious to distinguish myself
in single combat, I paused at the
spot where Bagsby had fallen. There
I found the illustrious delegate stretched
upon the ground, still grasping the
glorious colours. I stooped down and
examined the body, but I could discover
no wound. The blood that stained
his forehead was evidently not his
own.</p>

<p class='c009'>I loosened his neckcloth to give him
air, but still there were no signs of
animation. A crowd soon gathered
around us—the victors were returning
from the combat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He will never fight more!” said
the author of the Mysteries of Paris,
whom I now recognised among the
combatants. “He has led us on for
the last time to victory! Alas for the
adopted child of France! <i><span lang="fr">Un vrai
héros! Il est mort sur le champ de bataille!</span></i>
Messieurs, I propose that we
decree for our departed comrade the
honours of a public funeral!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER IV.<br> THE TUILLERIES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>“How do you feel yourself to-day,
Mr Bagsby?” said I, as I entered the
apartment of that heroic individual on
the following morning; “you made a
very close shave of it, I can tell you.
Eugène Sue wanted to have you
stretched upon a shutter, and carried
in procession as a victim through all
the streets of Paris.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Victim indeed!” replied Bagsby
manipulating the small of his back,
“I’ve been quite enough victimised
already. Hanged if I don’t get that
villain Albert impeached when I reach
England, that’s all! I worked among
them with the pickaxe till my arms
were nearly broken, and the only
thanks I got was to be shot at like a
popinjay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, Mr Bagsby, you have
covered yourself with glory. Every
one says that but for you the barricade
would inevitably have been carried.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They might have carried it to the
infernal regions for aught that I
cared,” replied Bagsby. “Catch me
fraternising again with any of them;
a disreputable set of scoundrels with
never a shirt to their back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You forget, my dear sir,” said I:
“Mr Cobden is of opinion that they
are the most affectionate and domesticated
people on the face of the
earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did Cobden say that?” cried
Bagsby: “then he’s a greater humbug
than I took him to be, and that
is saying not a little. He’ll never
get another testimonial out of me, I
can tell you. But pray, how did I
come here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you were just about to be
treated to a public funeral, when very
fortunately you exhibited some symptoms
of resuscitation, and a couple of
hairy patriots carried you to my lodgings.
Your exertions had been too
much for you. I must confess, Mr
Bagsby, I had no idea that you were
so bloodthirsty a personage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me bloodthirsty!” cried Bagsby,
“Lord bless you! I am like to faint
whenever I cut myself in shaving.
Guns and swords are my perfect abomination,
and I don’t think I could
bring myself to fire at a sparrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come! you do yourself injustice.
I shall never forget the brilliant
manner in which you charged
down the barricade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All I can tell you is, that I was deucedly
glad to hide myself in one of the
empty coaches. But when a bullet came
splash through the pannel within two
inches of my ear, I found the place was
getting too hot to hold me, and scrambled
out. I had covered myself with
one of their red rags by way of concealment,
and I suppose I brought it
out with me. As to jumping down,
you will allow it was full time to do
that, when fifty fellows were taking a
deliberate aim with their guns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are too modest, Mr Bagsby;
and, notwithstanding all your disclaimers,
you have gained a niche in
history as a hero. But come; this may
be a busy day, and it is already late.
Do you think you can manage any
breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll try,” said Bagsby; and, to do
him justice, he did.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our meal concluded, I proposed a
ramble, in order to ascertain the progress
of events, of which both of us
were thoroughly ignorant. Bagsby,
however, was extremely adverse to
leaving the house. He had a strong
impression that he would be again kidnapped,
and pressed into active service;
in which case he positively
affirmed that he would incontinently
give up the ghost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you stay comfortably here,”
said he, “and let’s have a little bottled
porter? These foreign chaps can
surely fight their own battles without
you or me; and that leads me to ask
if you know the cause of all this disturbance.
Hanged if I understand
any thing about it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe it mainly proceeds from
the King having forbidden some of
the deputies to dine together in
public.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t say so!” cried Bagsby:
“what an old fool he must be! Blowed
if I wouldn’t have taken the chair in
person, and sent them twelve dozen
of champagne to drink my health.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kings, Mr Bagsby, are rarely
endowed with a large proportion of
such sagacity as yours. But really we
must go forth and look a little about
us. It is past mid-day, and I cannot
hear any firing. You may rely upon
it that the contest has been settled in
one way or another—either the people
have been appeased, or, what is more
likely, the troops have sided with them.
We must endeavour to obtain some
information.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may do as you like,” said
Bagsby, “but my mind is made up.
I’m off for Havre this blessed afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear sir, you cannot. No passports
can be obtained just now, and
the mob has taken up the railroads.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an idiot I was ever to come
here!” groaned Bagsby. “Mercy on
me! must I continue in this den of
thieves, whether I will or no?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid there is no alternative.
But you judge the Parisians too
hastily, Mr Bagsby. I perceive they
have respected your watch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, but you heard what that chap
said about the slaughter-house lane. I
declare he almost frightened me into
fits. But where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out, to be sure. If you choose to
remain—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not I. Who knows but they may
take a fancy to seek for me here, and
carry me away again! I won’t part
with the only Englishman I know in
Paris, though I think it would be more
sensible to remain quietly where we
are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We threw ourselves into the stream
of people which was rapidly setting in
towards the Tuilleries. Great events
seemed to have happened, or at all
events to be on the eve of completion.
The troops were nowhere to be seen.
They had vanished from the city like
magic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Bon jour</span></i>, Citoyen Bagsby,” said
a harsh voice, immediately behind us.
“I hear high accounts of your valour
yesterday at the barricades. Allow
me to congratulate you on your first
revolutionary experiment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I turned round, and encountered
the sarcastic smile of M. Albert the
ouvrier. He was rather better dressed
than on the previous evening, and
had a tricolored sash bound around his
waist. With him was a crowd of
persons evidently in attendance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Should you like, Mr Bagsby, to
enter the service of the Republic? for
such, I have the honour to inform you,
France is now,” continued the
ouvrier. “We shall need a few practical
heads—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dear! I knew what it would
all come to!” groaned Bagsby.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t misapprehend me—I mean
heads to assist us in our new commercial
arrangements. Now, as free-trade
has succeeded so remarkably
well in Britain, perhaps you would
not object to communicate some of
your experiences to M. Crémieux,
who is now my colleague?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your colleague, M. Albert?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly so. I have the honour
to be one of the members of the Provisional
Government of France.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I in my senses or not?”
muttered Bagsby. “Oh, sir, whoever
you are, do be a good fellow for once,
and let me get home! I promise you, I
shall not say a word about this business
on the other side of the Channel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Far be it from me to lay any
restraint upon your freedom of speech,
Mr Bagsby. So, then, I conclude
you refuse? Well, be it so. After
all, I daresay Crémieux will get on
very well without you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But pray, M. Albert—one word,”
said I. “You mentioned a republic—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did. It has been established
for an hour. Louis Philippe has abdicated,
and in all probability is by
this time half a league beyond the
barrier. The Duchess of Orleans
came down with her son to the Chamber
of Deputies, and I really believe
there would have been a regency; for
the gallantry of France was moved,
and Barrot was determined on the
point. Little Ledru Rollin, however,
saved us from half measures. Rollin
is a clever fellow, with the soul of a
Robespierre; and, seeing how matters
were likely to go, he quietly
slipped to the door, and admitted a
select number of our friends from the
barricades. That put a stop to the
talking. You have no idea how quiet
gentlemen become in the presence of
a mob with loaded muskets. Their
hearts failed them; the deputies gradually
withdrew, and a republic was
proclaimed by the sovereign will of
the people. I am just on my way to
the Hotel de Ville, to assist in consolidating
the government.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Bon voyage</em>, M. Albert!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we shall do it, sure enough!
But here we are near the Tuilleries.
Perhaps, gentlemen, you would like
to enjoy the amusements which are
going on yonder, and to drink prosperity
to the new Republic in a glass
of Louis Philippe’s old Clos Vougeot.
If so, do not let me detain you.
Adieu!” And, with a spasmodic
twitch of his nose, the eccentric
ouvrier departed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! what things one does see
abroad, to be sure!” said Bagsby: “I
recollect him quite well at the time of
the Reform Bill—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, my dear Bagsby!” said I,
“This is not the moment nor the
place for any reminiscences of the
kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Certainly the aspect of what was
going forward in front of the Tuilleries
was enough to drive all minor memories
from the head of any man. A
huge bonfire was blazing in the midst
of the square opposite the Place du
Carrousel, and several thousands of
the populace were dancing round it
like demons. It was fed by the royal
carriages, the furniture of the staterooms,
and every combustible article
which could in any way be identified
with the fallen dynasty. The windows
of the palace were flung open, and
hangings, curtains, and tapestries of
silk and golden tissue, were pitched
into the square amidst shouts of glee
that would have broken the heart of
an upholsterer. It was the utter recklessness
of destruction. Yet, with all
this, there was a certain appearance
of honesty preserved. The people
might destroy to any amount they
pleased, but they were not permitted
to appropriate. The man who smashed
a mirror or shattered a costly vase
into flinders was a patriot,—he who
helped himself to an inkstand was
denounced as an ignominious thief.
I saw one poor devil, whose famished
appearance bore miserable testimony
to his poverty, arrested and searched;
a pair of paste buckles was found
upon him, and he was immediately
conducted to the gardens, and shot by
a couple of gentlemen who, five
minutes before, had deliberately slit
some valuable pictures into ribbons!
Every moment the crowd was receiving
accession from without, and the
bonfire materials from within. At
last, amidst tremendous acclamations,
the throne itself was catapulted into
the square, and the last symbol of
royalty reduced to a heap of ashes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole scene was so extremely
uninviting that I regretted having
come so far, and suggested to Bagsby
the propriety of an immediate retreat.
This, however, was not so easy.
Several of the citizens who were now
dancing democratic polkas round the
embers, had been very active partisans
at the barricade on the evening
before, and, as ill-luck would have it,
recognised their revivified champion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Trois mille rognons!</span></i>” exclaimed
my revolutionary friend the butcher,
“here’s the brave little Englishman
that led us on so gallantly against the
Municipal Guard! How is it with thee,
my fire-eater, my stout swallower of
bullets? Art thou sad that there is
no more work for thee to do? Cheer
up, citizen! we shall be at the frontiers
before long; and then who knows
but the Republic may reward thee with
the baton of a marshal of France!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Plus de maréchaux!</span></i>” cried a
truculent chiffonier, who was truculently
picking a marrow-bone with his
knife. “Such fellows are worth nothing
except to betray the people.
I waited to have a shot at old Soult
yesterday, but the rascal would not
show face!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind him, citizen,” said the
butcher, “we all know Père Pomme-de-terre.
But thou lookest pale! Art
thirsty? Come with me, and I will
show thee where old Macaire keeps
his cellar. France will not grudge a
flask to so brave a patriot as thyself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, ay! to the cellar—to the
cellar!” exclaimed some fifty voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Silence, mes enfans!</span></i>” cried the
butcher, who evidently had already
reconnoitred the interior of the subterranean
vaults. “Let us do all
things in order. As Citizen Lamartine
remarked, let virtue go hand in hand
with liberty, and let us apply ourselves
seriously to the consummation of this
great work. We have now an opportunity
of fraternising with the world.
We see amongst us an Englishman
who last night devoted his tremendous
energies to France. We thought
he had fallen, and were about to give
him public honours. Let us not be
more unmindful of the living than the
dead. Here he stands, and I now
propose that he be carried on the
shoulders of the people to the royal—<i><span lang="fr">peste!</span></i>—I
mean the republican cellar,
and that we there drink to the confusion
of all rank, and the union of all
nations in the bonds of universal
brotherhood!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Agreed! agreed!” shouted the
mob; and for the second time Bagsby
underwent the ceremony of entire
fraternisation. He was then hoisted
upon the shoulders of some half-dozen
patriots, notwithstanding a
melancholy howl, by which he intended
to express disapprobation of the
whole proceeding. I was pressed into
the service as interpreter, and took
care to attribute his disclaimer solely
to an excess of modesty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thou also wert at the barricade
last night,” said the butcher. “Thou,
too, hast struck a blow for France.
Come along. Let us cement with
wine the fraternity that originated in
blood!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, he laid hold of my arm,
and we all rushed towards the Tuilleries.
I would have given a trifle
to have been lodged at that moment
in the filthiest tenement of the Cowcaddens;
but any thing like resistance
was of course utterly out of the question.
In we thronged, a tumultuous
rabble of men and women, through
the portal of the Kings of France,
across the halls, and along the galleries,
all of them bearing already lamentable
marks of violence, outrage, and desecration.
Here was a picture of Louis
Philippe, a masterpiece by Horace
Vernet, literally riddled with balls;
there a statue of some prince, decapitated
by the blow of a hammer;
and in another place the fragments of
a magnificent vase, which had been
the gift of an emperor. Crowds of
people were sitting or lying in the
state apartments, eating, drinking,
smoking, and singing obscene ditties,
or wantonly but deliberately pursuing
the work of dismemberment. And
but a few hours before, this had been
the palace of the King of the Barricades!</p>

<p class='c009'>Down we went to the cellars, which
by this time were tolerably clear, as
most of the previous visitors had preferred
the plan of enjoying the abstracted
fluid in the upper and loftier
apartments. But such was not the
view of Monsieur Destripes the
butcher, or of his friend Pomme-de-terre.
These experienced bacchanals
preferred remaining at headquarters,
on the principle that the
<em>séance</em> ought to be declared permanent.
Bagsby, as the individual least
competent to enforce order, was
called to the chair, and seated upon
a kilderkin of Bordeaux, with a
spigot as the emblem of authority.
Then began a scene of brutal and
undisguised revelry. Casks were
tapped for a single sample, and their
contents allowed to run out in streams
upon the floor. Bottles were smashed
in consequence of the exceeding
scarcity of cork-screws, and the finest
vintage of the Côte d’Or and of
Champagne, were poured like water
down throats hitherto unconscious of
any such generous beverage.</p>

<p class='c009'>I need not dwell upon what followed—indeed
I could not possibly
do justice to the eloquence of M.
Pomme-de-terre, or the accomplishments
of several <em>poissardes</em>, who had
accompanied us in our expedition,
and now favoured us with sundry
erotic ditties, popular in the Faubourg
St Antoine. With these ladies Bagsby
seemed very popular: indeed, they
had formed themselves into a sort of
body-guard around his person.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sick of the whole scene, I availed
myself of the first opportunity to
escape from that tainted atmosphere;
and, after traversing most of the
state apartments, and several corridors,
I found myself in a part of the palace
which had evidently been occupied by
some of those who were now fleeing
as exiles towards a foreign land. The
hand of the spoiler also had been here,
but he was gone. It was a miserable
thing to witness the desolation of
these apartments. The bed whereon
a princess had lain the night before,
was now tossed and tumbled by some
rude ruffian, the curtains were torn
down, the gardes-de-robe broken
open, and a hundred articles of
female apparel and luxury were
scattered carelessly upon the floor.
The setting sun of February gleamed
through the broken windows, and
rendered the heartless work of spoliation
more distinct and apparent. I
picked up one handkerchief, still wet,
it might be with tears, and on the
corner of it was embroidered a royal
cypher.</p>

<p class='c009'>I, who was not an insurgent, almost
felt that, in penetrating through these
rooms, I was doing violence to the
sanctity of misfortune. Where, on the
coming night, might rest the head of
her who, a few hours before, had lain
upon that pillow of down? For the
shelter of what obscure and stifling
hut might she be forced to exchange
the noble ceiling of a palace? This
much I had gathered, that all the royal
family had not succeeded in making
their escape. Some of the ladies had
been seen, with no protectors by their
side, shrieking in the midst of the
crowd; but the cry of woe was that
day too general to attract attention,
and it seemed that the older chivalry
of France had passed away. Where
was the husband at the hour when
the wife was struggling in that rout
of terror?</p>

<p class='c009'>I turned into a side passage, and
opened another door. It was a small
room which apparently had escaped
observation. Every thing here bore
token of the purity of feminine taste.
The little bed was untouched: there
were flowers in the window, a breviary
upon the table, and a crucifix suspended
on the wall. The poor young
inmate of this place had been also
summoned from her sanctuary, never
more to enter it again. As I came
in, a little bird in a cage raised a loud
twittering, and began to beat itself
against the wires. The seed-box
was empty, and the last drop of water
had been finished. In a revolution
such as this, it is the fate of favourites
to be neglected.</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor thing was perishing of
hunger. I had no food to give it,
but I opened the cage and the window,
and set it free. With a shrill note of
joy, it darted off to the trees, happier
than its mistress, now thrown upon
the mercy of a rude and selfish world.
I looked down upon the scene beneath.
The river was flowing tranquilly to
the sea; the first breezes of spring
were moving through the trees, just
beginning to burgeon and expand;
the sun was sinking amidst the golden
clouds tranquilly—no sign in heaven
or earth betokened that on that day
a mighty monarchy had fallen. The
roar of Paris was hushed; the work of
desolation was over; and on the morrow,
its first day would dawn upon
the infant Republic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May Heaven shelter the unfortunate!”
I exclaimed; “and may my
native land be long preserved from
the visitation of a calamity like
this!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER V.<br> TWO PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>I awoke upon the morrow impressed
with that strange sensation
which is so apt to occur after the first
night’s repose in a new and unfamiliar
locality. I could not for some time
remember where I was. The events
of the two last days beset me like the
recollections of an unhealthy dream,
produced by the agency of opiates;
and it was with difficulty I could persuade
myself that I had passed the
night beneath the roof of the famous
Tuilleries.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all,” thought I, “the event
may be an interesting, but it is by no
means an unusual one, in this transitory
world of ours. Louis XVI.,
Napoleon, Charles X., Louis Philippe,
and Dunshunner, have by turns occupied
the palace, and none of them
have had the good fortune to leave it
in perpetuity to their issue. Since
abdication is the order of the day, I
shall even follow the example of my
royal predecessors, and bolt with as
much expedition as possible; for, to
say the truth, I am getting tired of
this turmoil, and I think, with Sir Kenneth
of Scotland, that the waters of
the Clyde would sound pleasant and
grateful in mine ear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A very slight toilet sufficed for the
occasion, and I sallied forth with the
full intention of making my immediate
escape. This was not so easy.
I encountered no one in the corridors,
but as I opened the door of the Salle
des Trophées, a din of many voices
burst upon my ears. A number of
persons occupied the hall, apparently
engaged in the discussion of an extempore
breakfast. To my infinite disgust,
I recognised my quondam acquaintances
of the cellar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aha! thou art still here then,
citizen?” cried Monsieur Destripes,
who was inflicting huge gashes upon
a ham, filched, probably, from the
royal buttery. “By my faith we
thought thou had’st given us the slip.
Never mind—we are not likely to
part soon; so sit thee down and partake
of our republican cheer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid,” said I, “that business
requires my presence elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let it keep till it cool then,” replied
the other. “Suffice it to say,
that no man quits this hall till the
whole of us march out <em>en masse</em>. Say
I right, brother Pomme-de-terre?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just so,” replied the chiffonier,
tossing off his draught from an ornament
of Venetian glass. “We have
built up a second barricade, and have
sworn never to surrender.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is this, gentlemen?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must know, sir,” replied a
meagre-looking personage, whom I
afterwards ascertained to be a barber,
“that the liberty of the people is not
yet secure. Last night, when we were
in the cellar, a large body of the National
Guard came, by orders of the
Provisional Government, and ejected
the whole of our compatriots from the
upper stories of the Tuilleries. This
we hold to be a clear infraction of the
charter, for all public buildings are
declared to be the property of the
people. Fortunately we escaped their
notice, but being determined to reassert
the rights of France, we have
barricaded the staircase which leads
to this hall, and are resolved to maintain
our post.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bravely spoken, old Saigne-du-nez!”
cried the butcher; “and a
jollier company you won’t find any
where. Here are ladies for society,
wine for the drinking, provisions to
last us a week; and what would you
wish for more? <i><span lang="fr">Cent mille haches!</span></i>
I doubt if Louis Philippe is enjoying
himself half so much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But really, gentlemen—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Sacre</em>, no mutiny!” cried the
butcher; “don’t we know that the
sovereign will of the people must be
respected? There is thy friend there,
as happy as may be; go round and
profit by his example.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sure enough I discovered poor
Bagsby extended in a corner of the
hall. The orgies of last evening were
sufficient to account for his haggard
countenance and blood-shot eyes, but
hardly for the multitudinous oaths
which he ejaculated from time to
time. Beside him sat a bloated
poissarde, who was evidently enamoured
of his person, and tended him
with all that devotion which is the
characteristic of the gentler sex. As
it was beyond the power of either to
hold any intelligible conversation, the
lady contrived to supply its place by
a system of endearing pantomime.
Sometimes she patted Bagsby on the
cheek, then chirupped as a girl might
do when coaxing a bird to open its
mouth, and occasionally endeavoured
to insinuate morsels of garlic and
meat between his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr Dunshunner! save me
from this hag!” muttered Bagsby.
“I have such a splitting headach,
and she will insist on poisoning me
with her confounded trash! Faugh,
how she smells of eels! Oh dear! oh
dear! is there no way of getting
out? The barricades and the fighting
are nothing compared to this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid, Mr Bagsby,” said I,
“there is no remedy but patience.
Our friends here seem quite determined
to hold out, and I am afraid
that they would use little ceremony,
did we make any show of resistance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know that well enough!” said
Bagsby: “they wanted to hang me
last night, because I made a run to
the door: only, the women would not
let them. What do you want, you
old harridan? I wish you would take
your fingers from my neck!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Ce cher bourgeois!</span></i>” murmured
the poissarde: “<i><span lang="fr">c’est un méchant drôle,
mais assez joli!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon my word, Mr Bagsby, I
think you have reason to congratulate
yourself on your conquest. At
all events, don’t make enemies of the
women; for, heaven knows, we are in
a very ticklish situation, and I don’t
like the looks of several of those
fellows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If ever I get home again,” said
Bagsby, “I’ll renounce my errors,
turn Tory, go regularly to church,
and pray for the Queen. I’ve had
enough of liberty to last me the rest
of my natural lifetime. But, I say,
my dear friend, couldn’t you just rid
me of this woman for half an hour or
so? You will find her a nice chatty
sort of person; only, I don’t quite
comprehend what she says.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Utterly impossible, Mr Bagsby!
See, they are about something now.
Our friend the barber is rising to speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizens!” said Saigne-du-nez,
speaking as from a tribune, over the
back of an arm-chair—“Citizens! we
are placed by the despotism of our
rulers in an embarrassing position.
We, the people, who have won the
palace and driven forth the despot and
his race, are now ordered to evacuate
the field of our glory, by men who
have usurped the charter, and who
pretend to interpret the law. I declare
the sublime truth, that, with the
revolution, all laws, human and divine,
have perished! (Immense applause.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizens! isolated as we are by
this base decree from the great body
of the people, it becomes us to constitute
a separate government for
ourselves. Order must be maintained,
but such order as shall strike terror
into the breasts of our enemies.
France has been assailed through us,
and we must vindicate her freedom.
Amongst us are many patriots, able
and willing to sustain the toils of
government; and I now propose that
we proceed to elect a provisional
ministry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The motion was carried by acclamation,
and the orator proceeded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizens! amongst our numbers
there is one man who has filled the
most lofty situations. I allude to
Citizen Jupiter Potard. Actor in a
hundred revolutions, he has ever
maintained the sublime demeanour of
a patriot of the Reign of Terror.
Three generations have regarded him
as a model, and I now call upon him
to assume the place and dignity of
our President.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jupiter Potard, a very fine-looking
old man, with a beard about a yard
long,—who was really a model, inasmuch
as he had sat in that capacity
for the last thirty years to the artists
of Paris,—was then conducted, amidst
general applause, to a chair at the head
of the table. Jupiter, I am compelled
to add, seemed rather inebriated; but,
as he did not attempt to make any
speeches, that circumstance did not
operate as a disqualification.</p>

<p class='c009'>The remainder of the administration
was speedily formed. Destripes became
Minister of the Interior: Pomme-de-terre
received the Portfolio of Justice.
A gentleman, who rejoiced in the
sobriquet of Gratte-les-rues, was
made Minister of War. Saigne-du-nez
appointed himself to the Financial
Department, and I was unanimously
voted the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
These were the principal offices of
the Republic, and to us the functions
of government were confided. Bagsby,
at the request of the poissardes, received
the honorary title of Minister
of Marine.</p>

<p class='c009'>A separate table was ordered for
our accommodation; and our first
decree, countersigned by the Minister
of the Interior, was an order for a
fresh subsidy from the wine-cellar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here a sentry, who had been stationed
at a window, announced the approach
of a detachment of the National
Guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizen Minister of War!” said
Saigne-du-nez, who, without any
scruple, had usurped the functions of
poor old Jupiter Potard, “this is
your business. It is my opinion that
the provisional government cannot receive
a deputation of this kind. Let
them announce their intentions at the
barricade without.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gratte-les-rues, a huge ruffian with
a squint, straightway shouldered his
musket, and left the room. In a few
minutes he returned with a paper,
which he cast upon the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A decree from the Hotel de
Ville,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it your pleasure, citizen colleagues,
that this document should
now be read?” asked Saigne-du-nez.</p>

<p class='c009'>All assented, and, as Minister of
Foreign Affairs, the following document
was placed in my hands. It was
listened to with profound attention.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Unity is the soul of the French
nation; it forms its grandeur, its
power, and its glory; through unity
we have triumphed, and the rights of
the people have been vindicated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Impressed with these high and
exalted sentiments, and overflowing
with that fraternity which is the life-blood
of our social system, the Provisional
Government decrees:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I. That the Tuilleries, now denominated
the Hôpital des Invalides
Civiles, shall be immediately evacuated
by the citizens who have so
bravely wrested it from the tyrant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“II. That each patriot, on leaving
it, shall receive from the public treasury
the sum of five francs, or an
equivalent in coupons.</p>

<p class='c014'>“III. The Minister of the Interior
is charged with the execution of this
decree.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i><span lang="fr">Sang de Mirabeau!</span></i>” cried Destripes,
when I had finished the perusal
of this document, “do they take us
for fools! Five francs indeed! This
is the value which these aristocrats
place upon the blood of the people!
Citizen colleagues, I propose that the
messenger be admitted and immediately
flung out of the window!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I second the motion,” said
Pomme-de-terre.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, citizens!” cried Saigne-du-nez,—“no
violence. I agree that we
cannot entertain the offer, but this is
a case for negotiation. Let the Minister
of Foreign Affairs draw up a
protocol in reply.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In consequence of this suggestion I
set to work, and, in a few minutes, produced
the following manifesto, which
may find a place in some subsequent

<p class='c017'>“France is free. The rights of
every Frenchman, having been gained
by himself, are sacred and inviolable;
the rights of property are abrogated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indivisibility is a fundamental
principle of the nation. It applies
peculiarly to public works. That
which the nation gave the nation now
resumes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We protest against foreign aggression.
Satisfied with our own
triumph, we shall remain tranquil.
We do not ask possession of the Hotel
de Ville, but we are prepared to maintain
our righteous occupation of the
Tuilleries.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Impressed with these high and
exalted sentiments, the Provisional
Government of the Tuilleries decrees:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I. That it is inexpedient to lessen
the glory of France, by entrusting the
charge of the Tuilleries to any other
hands, save those of the brave citizens
who have so nobly captured it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“II. That the Provisional Government
do not recognise coupons as a

<p class='c016'>This document was unanimously
adopted as the true exponent of our
sentiments; and I was highly complimented
by my colleagues on my
diplomatic ability. I took occasion,
however, to fold up the following note
along with the despatch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If Citizen Albert has any regard
for his English friends, he will immediately
communicate their situation to
the citizen Monte-Christo. Here, affairs
look very ill. The public tranquillity
depends entirely upon the
supply of liquor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This business being settled, we occupied
ourselves with more industrial
duties. The finance was easily disposed
of. There were but four francs,
six sous, leviable among the whole
community; but Gratte-les-rues, with
instinctive acuteness, had discovered
the watch and chain of the unfortunate
Minister of Marine, and these were
instantly seized and confiscated as
public property.</p>

<p class='c009'>On investigation we found that the
larder was but indifferently supplied.
Due allowance being made for the inordinate
appetite of the poissardes, of
whom there were about ten in our company,
it was calculated that our stock
of food could not last for more than
a couple of days. On the other hand,
there was a superabundance of wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>We then proceeded to adjust a
scheme for the future regulation of
labour throughout France; but I do
not think that I need trouble my
readers with the detail. It did not
differ materially from that propounded
by M. Louis Blanc, and the substance
of it might shortly be stated as—three
days’ wage for half-a-day’s labour.
It was also decreed, that all servants
should receive, in addition to their
wages, a proportion of their master’s
profits.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some hours of legislation,
not altogether harmonious—for Destripes,
being baulked in a proposition
to fire the palace, threatened to string
up old Jupiter Potard to the chandelier,
and was only prevented from
doing so by the blunderbuss of Saigne-du-nez—we
grew weary of labour,
and the orgies commenced anew. I
have neither patience nor stomach to
enter into a description of the scene
that was there and then enacted. In
charity to the human race, let me
hope that such a spectacle may never
again be witnessed in the heart of a
Christian city.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Bagsby suffered fearfully.
The affection of the poissarde had
gradually augmented to a species of
insanity, and she never left him for a
moment. The unhappy man was dragged
out by her to every dance; she
gloated on him like an ogress surveying
a plump and pursy pilgrim; and
at the close of each set she demanded
the fraternal salute. He tried to
escape from his persecutor by dodging
round the furniture; but it was of no
use. She followed him as a ferret
follows a rabbit through all the intricacies
of his warren, and invariably
succeeded in capturing her booty in a
corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length night came, and with it
silence. One by one the revellers
had fallen asleep, some still clutching
the bottle, which they had plied with
unabated vigour so long as sensibility
remained, and the broad calm moon
looked on reproachfully through the
windows of that desecrated hall.
There was peace in heaven, but on
earth—oh, what madness and pollution!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was lying wrapped up in some
old tapestry, meditating very seriously
upon my present precarious situation,
when I observed a figure moving
amidst the mass of sleepers. The
company around was of such a nature,
that unpleasant suspicions
naturally occurred to my mind, and I
continued to watch the apparition
until the moonlight shone upon it,
when I recognised Bagsby. This
poor fellow was a sad incubus upon
my motions; for although I had no
earthly tie towards him, I could not
help feeling that in some measure I
had been instrumental in placing him
in his present dilemma, and I had
resolved not to escape without making
him the partner of my flight. I was
very curious to know the object of his
present movements, for the stealthy
manner in which he glided through
the hall betokened some unusual
purpose. I was not long left in
doubt. From behind a large screen
he drew forth a coil of cord, formerly
attached to the curtain, but latterly
indicated by Destripes as the implement
for Potard’s apotheosis; and
approaching a window, he proceeded
to attach one end of it very deliberately
to a staple. He then gave a
cautious glance around, as if to be
certain that no one was watching
him, and began to undo the fastenings
of the window. A new gleam of hope
dawned upon me. I was about to
rise and move to his assistance, when
another figure glided rapidly through
the moonshine. In an instant Bagsby
was clutched by the throat, and a
low voice hissed out—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em><span lang="fr">Ah traître!<a id='t506'></a> monstre! polisson!
vous voulez donc fuir? Vous osez mépriser
mon amour!</span></em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the poissarde. Nothing on
earth is so wakeful as a jealous woman.
She had suspected the designs
of the wretched Minister of Marine,
and counterfeited sleep only to detect
him in the act of escaping.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a moment was to be lost. I
knew that if this woman gave the
alarm, Bagsby would inevitably be
hanged with his own rope, and I stole
towards the couple, in order to effect,
if possible, a reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, citizen, is it thou?” said
the poissarde more loudly than was
at all convenient. “Here is thy
fellow trying to play me a pretty
trick! Perfidious monster! was this
what thou meant by all thy professions
of love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For heaven’s sake, take the
woman off, or she will strangle me!”
muttered Bagsby.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, hush! my dear madam,
hush!” said I, “or you may wake
some of our friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What care I,” said the poissarde;
“let them wake, and I will denounce
the villain who has dared to trifle with
my affections!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, but consider the consequences!”
said I. “Do, pray, be
silent for one moment. Bagsby, this
is a bad business!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not tell me that,”
groaned Bagsby.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your life depends upon this woman,
and you must appease her somehow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll agree to any thing,” said the
terrified Minister of Marine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! I will be avenged!” cried
the poissarde; “I will have his heart’s
blood, since he has dared to deceive
me. How! is this the way they treat
a daughter of the people?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citoyenne!” I said, “you are
wrong—utterly wrong. Believe me,
he loves you passionately. What
proof do you desire?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let him marry me to-morrow,”
said the poissarde, “in this very room,
or I shall immediately raise the alarm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I tried to mitigate the sentence, but
the poissarde was perfectly obdurate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bagsby, there is no help for it!”
said I. “We are in the midst of a revolution,
and must go along with it.
She insists upon you marrying her to-morrow.
The alternative is instant
death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do it,” said Bagsby, quietly;
“any thing is better than being murdered
in cold blood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The countenance of the poissarde
brightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aha!” said she, taking the submissive
Bagsby by the ear, “so thou
art to be my republican husband after
all, <i><span lang="fr">coquin</span></i>? Come along. I shall
take care that thou dost not escape
again to-night, and to-morrow I shall
keep thee for ever!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, she conducted her captive
to the other end of the hall.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER VI.<br> A REPUBLICAN WEDDING.</h3>

<p class='c023'>“This is great news!” said Destripes,
as we mustered round the revolutionary
breakfast table. “Hast
heard, citizen? Our colleague the
Minister of Marine is about to contract
an alliance with a daughter of
the people. <i><span lang="fr">Corbleu!</span></i> There is no
such sport as a regular republican
marriage!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In my early days,” said Jupiter
Potard, “we had them very frequently.
The way was, to tie two
young aristocrats together, and throw
them into the Seine. How poor dear
Carrier used to laugh at the fun!
Oh, my friends! we shall never see
such merry times again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, don’t be down-hearted,
old fellow!” cried Destripes. “We
never can tell what is before us. I
don’t despair of seeing something yet
which might make the ghost of Collot
d’Herbois rub its hands with ecstasy.
But to our present work. Let us get
over the business of the day, and then
celebrate the wedding with a roaring
festival.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where are we to find a
priest?” asked Saigne-du-nez. “I
question whether any of our fraternity
has ever taken orders.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Priest!” cried Destripes ferociously.
“Is this an age of superstition?
I tell thee, Saigne-du-nez, that
if any such fellow were here, he
should presently be dangling from the
ceiling! What better priest would’st
thou have than our venerable friend
Potard?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, ay!” said Pomme-de-terre,
“Potard will do the work famously.
I’ll warrant me, with that long beard
of his, he has sate for a high-priest
ere now. But look at Citoyenne
Corbeille, how fond she seems of her
bargain. <em>Ventrebleu!</em> our colleague
is sure to be a happy man!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever happiness might be in
store for Bagsby hereafter, there was
no appearance of it just then. He
sate beside his bride like a criminal
on the morning of his execution; and
such efforts as he did make to respond
to her attentions were rueful and
ludicrous in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c009'>Breakfast over, we proceeded to
council; but as we had no deputations
to receive, and no fresh arrangements
to make, our sitting was rather brief.
Bagsby, in order, as I supposed, to
gain time, entreated me to broach the
topics of free-trade and unrestricted
international exchange; but recent
events had driven the doctrines of
Manchester from my head, and somewhat
shaken my belief in the infallibility
of the prophets of the League.
Besides, I doubted very much whether
our Provisional Ministry cared one
farthing for duties upon calico and
linen, neither of these being articles
in which they were wont exorbitantly
to indulge; and I perfectly understood
the danger of appearing over tedious
upon any subject in a society so
strangely constituted. I therefore
turned a deaf ear to the prayers of
Bagsby, and refused to enlighten the
council at the risk of the integrity of
my neck. No reply whatever had
been made by the authorities without,
to our communication of the previous
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>One o’clock was the hour appointed
by the Provisional Government for the
nuptial ceremony, which was to be
performed with great solemnity.
About twelve the bride, accompanied
by three other poissardes, retired, in
order to select from the stores of the
palace a costume befitting the occasion.
In the meantime, I had great difficulty
in keeping up the courage of Bagsby,—indeed,
he was only manageable
through the medium of doses of brandy.
At times he would burst out into a
paroxysm of passion, and execrate
collectively and individually the whole
body of the Manchester League, who
had sent him upon this unfortunate
mission to Paris. This profanity over,
he would burst into tears, bewail his
wretched lot, and apostrophise a certain
buxom widow, who seemed to
dwell somewhere in the neighbourhood
of Macclesfield. As for the
French, the outpourings from the vial
of his wrath upon that devoted nation
were most awful and unchristian.
The plagues of Egypt were a joke to
the torments which he invoked upon
their heads; and I felt intensely
thankful that not one of our companions
understood a syllable of English,
else the grave would inevitably have
been the bridal couch of the Bagsby.</p>

<p class='c009'>It now became my duty to see the
bridegroom properly attired; for
which purpose, with permission of our
colleagues, I conducted Bagsby to a
neighbouring room, where a full suit
of uniform, perhaps the property of
Louis Philippe, had been laid out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come now, Mr Bagsby,” said I,
observing that he was about to renew
his lamentations, “we have had quite
enough of this. You have brought it
upon yourself. Had you warned me
of your design last night, it is quite
possible that both of us might have
escaped; but you chose to essay the
adventure single-handed, and, having
failed, you must stand by the consequences.
After all, what is it?
Merely marriage, a thing which almost
every man must undergo at least once
in his lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! but such a woman—such a
she-devil rather!” groaned Bagsby.
“I shouldn’t be the least surprised if
she bites as bad as a crocodile.
How can I ever take such a monster
home, and introduce her to my
friends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see no occasion for that, my
good fellow. Why not stay here and
become a naturalised Frenchman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here? I’d as soon think of staying
in a lunatic asylum! Indeed I
may be in one soon enough, for flesh
and blood can’t stand this kind of torture
long. But I say,” continued he,
a ray of hope flashing across his countenance,
“they surely can’t make it
a real marriage after all. Hanged if
any one of these blackguards is a
clergyman; and even if he was, they
haven’t got a special license.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t deceive yourself, Mr Bagsby,”
said I; “marriage in France is a
mere social contract, and can be established
by witnesses, of whom there
will be but too many present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I say they are an infernal
set of incarnate pestiferous heathens!
What! marry a man whether he
will or not, and out of church!
It’s enough to draw down a judgment
upon the land.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You forget, Mr Bagsby. You
need not marry unless you choose; it
is a mere question of selection between
a wedding and an execution,—between
the lady and a certain rope,
which, I can assure you, Monsieur Destripes,
or his friend Gratte-les-rues,
will have no hesitation in handling.
Indeed, from significant symptoms, I
conclude that their fingers are itching
for some such practice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are indeed two horrid-looking
blackguards!” said Bagsby
dolefully. “I wish I had pluck
enough to be hanged: after all, it
could not be much worse than marriage.
And yet I don’t know. There
may be some means of getting a
divorce, or she may drink herself to
death, for, between you and me, she
seems awfully addicted to the use of
ardent spirits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fie! Mr Bagsby; how can you
talk so of your bride upon the wedding-day!
Be quick! get into those
trousers, and never mind the fit.
It may be dangerous to keep them
waiting long; and, under present
circumstances, it would be prudent
to abstain from trying the temper of
the lady too severely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never thought to be married this
way!” sighed Bagsby, putting on
the military coat, which, being stiff
with embroidery, and twice too big
for him, stuck out like an enormous
cuirass. “If my poor old mother
could see me now, getting into the
cast-off clothes of some outlandish
Frenchman—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She would admire you exceedingly,
I am sure. Do you know you
look quite warlike with these epaulets!
Come now—on with the
sash, take another thimble-ful of
brandy, and then to the altar like a
man!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I daresay you mean well, Mr
Dunshunner; but I have listened to
more pleasant conversation. I say—what
is to prevent my getting up the
chimney?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mere madness! The moment
you are missed they will fire up it.
Believe me, you have not a chance of
escape; so the sooner you resign
yourself to your inevitable destiny
the better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here a loud knocking was heard at
the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizen Minister of Marine, art
thou ready?” cried the voice of
Pomme-de-terre. “Thy bride is
waiting for thee, the altar is decked,
and Père Potard in his robes of
office!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, then,” said I, seizing
Bagsby by the arm. “Take courage,
man! In ten minutes it will all be
over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Our colleagues had not been idle in
the interim. At one end of the hall
they had built up an extempore altar
covered with a carpet, behind which
stood Jupiter Potard, arrayed in a
royal mantle of crimson velvet, which
very possibly in former days might
have decorated the shoulders of Napoleon.
Indeed the imperial eagle was
worked upon it in gold, and it had
been abstracted from one of the
numerous repositories of the palace.
Jupiter, with his long beard and
fine sloping forehead, looked the
perfect image of a pontiff, and might
have been appropriately drawn as a
principal figure in a picture of the
marriage of Heliogabalus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gratte-les-rues and Pomme-de-terre,
being of bellicose temperament,
had encased themselves in suits of
armour, and stood, like two champions
of antiquity, on each side of
the venerable prelate. Destripes,
who had accepted the office of temporary
father to Demoiselle Corbeille,
appeared as a patriot of the Reign
of Terror. His brawny chest was
bare; his shirt-sleeves rolled up to
the shoulder; and in his belt was
stuck the axe, a fitting emblem alike
of his principles and his profession.</p>

<p class='c009'>At his right hand stood the bride,
bedizened with brocade and finery.
From what antiquated lumber-chest
they had fished out her apparel, it
would be utterly in vain to inquire.
One thing was clear, that the former
occupant of the robes had been decidedly
inferior in girth to the blooming
poissarde, since it was now necessary
to fasten them across the bosom
by a curious net-work of tape. I am
afraid I have done injustice to this
lady, for really, on the present occasion,
she did not look superlatively
hideous. She was a woman of about
forty-five, strong-built, with an immense
development of foot and ancle,
and arms of masculine proportion. Yet
she had a pair of decidedly fine black
eyes, betokening perhaps little of
maiden modesty, but flashing with
love and triumph; a <i><span lang="fr">nez retroussé</span></i>,
which, but for its perpetual redness,
might have given a piquant expression
to her countenance; a large
mouth, and a set of prodigious teeth,
which, to say the truth, were enough
to justify the apprehensions of the
bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silence!” cried Jupiter Potard as
we entered; “let the present august
solemnity be conducted as befits the
sovereignty of the people! Citizen
Saigne-du-nez, advance!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saigne-du-nez was clad in a black
frock, I suppose to represent a notary.
He came forward:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the name of the French nation,
one and indivisible, I demand the
celebration of the nuptials of Citizen
Hutton Bagsby, adopted child of
France, and Provisional Minister of
her Marine in the department of the
Tuilleries, and of Citoyenne Céphyse
Corbeille, poissarde, and daughter of
the people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there any one here to gainsay
the marriage?” asked Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, in the name of the French
nation, I decree that the ceremony
shall proceed. Citizen Minister of
Marine, are you willing to take this
woman as your lawful wife?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A cold sweat stood upon the brow
of Bagsby, his knees knocked together,
and he leaned the whole weight of his
body upon my arm, as I interpreted
to him the demand of Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say any thing you like,” muttered
he; “it will all come to the same
thing at last!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The citizen consents, most venerable
President.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then nothing remains but to put
the same question to the citoyenne,”
said Potard. “Who appears as the
father of the bride?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr">Chûte de la Bastille!</span></i> that do I,”
cried Destripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizen Destripes, do you of your
own free will and accord—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here a thundering rap was heard at
the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is that?” cried Destripes
starting back. “Some one has passed
the barricade!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the name of the Provisional
Government!” cried a loud voice.
The door was flung open, and to my
inexpressible joy, I beheld the Count
of Monte-Christo, backed by a large
detachment of the National Guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Treason! treachery!” shouted
Destripes. “Ah, villain, thou hast
neglected thy post!” and he fetched a
tremendous blow with his axe at the
head of Gratte-les-rues. It was fortunate
for that chief that his helmet
was of excellent temper, otherwise he
must have been cloven to the chin.
As it was, he staggered backwards and
fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The National Guard immediately
presented their muskets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have the honour to inform the
citizens,” said Monte-Christo, “that
I have imperative orders to fire if the
slightest resistance is made. Monsieur,
therefore, will have the goodness
immediately to lay down that axe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Destripes glared on him for a moment,
as though he meditated a rush,
but the steady attitude of the National
Guard involuntarily subdued him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is freedom!” he exclaimed,
flinging away his weapon. “This is
what we fought for at the barricades!
Always deceived—always sold by the
aristocrats! But the day may come
when I shall hold a tight reckoning
with thee, my master, or I am not
the nephew of the citizen Samson!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, may I ask the meaning of
this extraordinary scene?” said Monte-Christo,
gazing in astonishment at
the motley group before him. “Is it
the intention of the gentlemen to institute
a Crusade, or have we lighted
by chance upon an assemblage of the
chivalry of Malta?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither,” I replied. “The fact
is, that just as you came in we were
engaged in celebrating a republican
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Far be it from me to interfere with
domestic or connubial arrangements!”
replied the polite Monte-Christo.
“Let the marriage go on, by all
means; I shall be delighted to witness
it, and we can proceed to business
thereafter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will see no marriage here,
I can tell you!” cried Bagsby, who at
the first symptom of relief had taken
shelter under the shadow of the Marquis.
“I put myself under your protection;
and, by Jove, if you don’t
help me, I shall immediately complain
to Lord Normanby!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is this?” cried Monte-Christo.
“Do I see Monsieur Bagsby
in a general’s uniform? Why,
my good sir, you have become a
naturalised Frenchman indeed! The
nation has a claim upon you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The nation will find it very difficult
to get it settled then!” said
Bagsby. “But I want to get out.
I say, can’t I get away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. There is nothing to
prevent you. But I am rather curious
to hear about this marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” said I, “the truth is, my
dear Marquis, that the subject is
rather a delicate one for our friend.
He has just been officiating in the
capacity of bridegroom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You amaze me!” said Monte-Christo;
“and which, may I ask, is
the fair lady?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Demoiselle Céphyse came
forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizen officer,” she said, “I
want my husband!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You hear, Monsieur Bagsby?”
said Monte-Christo, in intense enjoyment
of the scene. “The lady says
she has a claim upon you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all a lie!” shouted Bagsby.
“I’ve got nothing to say to the woman.
I hate and abhor her!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Monstre!</em>” shrieked the poissarde,
judging of Bagsby’s ungallant repudiation
rather from his gestures than
his words. And she sprang towards
him with the extended talons of a
tigress. Bagsby, however, was this
time too nimble for her, and took
refuge behind the ranks of the National
Guard, who were literally in
convulsions of laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will have thee, though, <i><span lang="fr">polisson</span></i>!”
cried the exasperated bride. “I will
have thee, though I were to follow
thee to the end of the world! Thou
hast consented to be my husband,
little <i><span lang="fr">tisserand</span></i>, and I never will give
thee up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep her off! good, dear soldiers,”
cried Bagsby: “pray, keep her off!
I shall be murdered and torn to pieces
if she gets hold of me! Oh, Mr
Dunshunner! do tell them to protect
me with their bayonets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be under no alarm, Mr Bagsby,”
said Monte-Christo; “you are now
under the protection of the National
Guard. But to business. Which of the
citizens assembled is spokesman here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the president!” hiccupped
Jupiter Potard, who, throughout the
morning, had been unremitting in his
attentions to the bottle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, you will understand that,
by orders of the Provisional Government,
all must evacuate the palace
within a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Louis Philippe had seventeen
years of it,” replied Jupiter Potard.
“I won’t abdicate a minute sooner!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I,” said Pomme-de-terre,
“expect a handsome pension for my
pains.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or at least,” said Saigne-du-nez,
“we must have permission to gut the
interior.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have done quite enough
mischief already,” said Monte-Christo;
“so prepare to move. My orders are
quite peremptory, and I shall execute
them to the letter!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along, then, citizens!”
cried Destripes. “I always knew
what would come of it, if these
rascally <em>bourgeoisie</em> got the upper hand
of the workmen. They are
all black aristocrats in their hearts.
But, by the head of Robespierre, thou
shalt find that thy government is not
settled yet, and there shall be more
blood before we let them trample
down the rights of the people!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, the democratic butcher
strode from the apartment, followed
by the rest of the Provisional Government
and their adherents, each retaining
the garb which he had chosen
to wear in honour of the nuptials of
Bagsby. The poissarde lingered
for a moment, eying her faithless betrothed
as he stood in the midst of
the Guard, like a lioness robbed of
her cub: and then, with a cry of
wrath, and a gesture of menace, she
rushed after her companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank Heaven!” cried Bagsby,
dropping on his knees, “the bitterest
hour of my whole existence is
over!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER VII.<br> ADIEU, SWEET FRANCE!</h3>

<p class='c023'>“And so you received the message
from M. Albert?” said I to Monte-Christo,
as we walked together to the
Hotel de Ville,</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did; and, to say the truth, I
was rather apprehensive about you.
Revolutions are all very well: but it
is a frightful thing when the dregs of
the population get the upper hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear you acknowledge
so much. For my part, Marquis,
having seen one revolution, I
never wish to witness another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We could not possibly avoid it,”
said Monte-Christo. “It was a mere
question of time. No one doubts that
a revolutionary spirit may be carried
too far.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you contrive to write it
down?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unfortunately, the majority of
gentlemen with whom you have lately
been associating, are not strongly
addicted to letters. I question whether
M. Destripes has even read La Tour
de Nêsle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he had,” said I, “it must have
tended very greatly to his moral improvement.
But how is it with the
Provisional Government?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Faith, I must own they are rather
in a critical position. Had it not been
for Lamartine—who, I must confess,
is a noble fellow, and a man of undaunted
courage—they would have
been torn to pieces long ago. Hitherto
they have managed tolerably by means
of the National Guard; but the atmosphere
is charged with thunder. Here
we are, however, at the Hotel de
Ville.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not the least curious of the revolutionary
scenes of Paris was the aspect
of the seat of government. At
the moment I reached it, many
thousands of the lower orders were
assembled in front, and one of the
Provisional Government, I believe
Louis Blanc, was haranguing them
from a window. Immense crowds
were likewise gathered round the
entrance. These consisted of the deputations,
who were doing their very
best to exhaust the physical energies,
and distract the mental powers, of the
men who had undertaken the perilous
task of government.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under conduct of my friend, I made
my way to the room where the mysterious
<em>ouvrier</em> was performing his
part of the onerous duty. He greeted
me with a brief nod and a grim smile,
but did not pretermit his paternal
functions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The body which occupied his attention
at this crisis of the commonwealth,
was a musical deputation,
which craved sweet counsel regarding
some matter of crochets or of bars.
It is not the first time that music has
been heard in the midst of stirring
events. Nero took a fancy to fiddle
when Rome was blazing around him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I could not but admire the gravity
with which Albert listened to the
somewhat elaborate address, and the
dexterity with which he contrived to
blend the subjects of pipes and patriotism.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Citizens!” he said, “the Provisional
Government are deeply impressed
with the importance of the
views which you advocate. Republican
institutions cannot hope to exist
without music, for to the sound of
music even the spheres themselves
revolve in the mighty and illimitable
expanse of ether.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At this crisis your suggestions
become doubly valuable. I have listened
to them with emotions which
I would struggle in vain to express.
Oh, that we may see the day when,
with a glorious nation as an orchestra,
the psalm of universal freedom may
rise in a swell of triumphant jubilee!</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it will come! Rely upon
us. Return to your homes. Cherish
fraternity and music. Meantime we
shall work without intermission for
your sake. Harmony is our sole
object: believe me that, in reconstituted
France, there shall be nothing
but perfect harmony!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The deputation withdrew in tears;
and another entered to state certain
grievances touching the manufacture
of steel beads. I need not say that in
this, as in several other instances, the
<em>ouvrier</em> comported himself like an eminent
member of the Society of Universal
Knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the last of them, praise
be to Mumbo Jumbo!” said he, as
the representatives of the shoeblacks
departed. “Faith, this is work hard
enough to kill a horse. So, Mr
Dunshunner! you have been getting
up a counter-revolution at the Tuilleries,
I see. How are Monsieur
Potard and all the rest of your colleagues?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid they are finally expelled
from paradise,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Serve them right! a parcel of democratic
scum. And what has become
of Citizen Bagsby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have sent him to my hotel.
He was in reality very near becoming
an actual child of France.” And I told
the story of the nuptials, at which the
<em>ouvrier</em> nearly split himself with laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Mr Dunshunner,” said
he at length, “may I ask the nature
of your plans?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“These may depend a good deal
upon your advice,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never give advice,” replied the
<em>ouvrier</em> with a nasal twitch. “Sometimes
it is rather dangerous. But tell
me—what would you think of the
state of the British government, if
Earl Grey at a cabinet-council were
to threaten to call in the mob, and if
Lord Johnny Russell prevented him
by clapping a pistol to his ear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think very badly of it
indeed,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or if Incapability Wood should
threaten, in the event of the populace
appearing, to produce from the Earl’s
pocket a surreptitious order on the
treasury for something like twelve
thousand pounds?”</p>

<p class='c009'> “Worse still.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then; I don’t think you’ll
find <em>that</em> sort of thing going on in
London, at all events.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you any commands for the
other side of the Channel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, then, you are determined to
leave? Well, perhaps upon the whole
it is your wisest plan. And—I say—just
tell them that if things look
worse, I may be over one of these fine
mornings. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so, with a cordial pressure of
the hand, we parted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Monte-Christo,” I said, as that
very evening I bundled Bagsby into a
<em>fiacre</em> on our way to the railroad station—“Monte-Christo,
my good fellow,
let me give you a slight piece of
advice, which it would be well if all
of our craft and calling would keep in
memory,—‘<span class='sc'>Think twice before
you write up another revolution</span>.’”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE CAXTONS—A FAMILY PICTURE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c022'>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class='c023'>“Sir—sir—it is a boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A boy,” said my father, looking
up from his book, and evidently much
puzzled; “what is a boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, my father did not mean by
that interrogatory to challenge philosophical
inquiry, nor to demand of the
honest but unenlightened woman who
had just rushed into his study, a
solution of that mystery, physiological
and psychological, which has puzzled
so many curious sages, and lies still
involved in the question, “What is
man?” For, as we need not look
farther than Dr Johnson’s Dictionary
to know that a boy is “a male
child”—<em>i. e.</em>, the male young of man;
so he who would go to the depth of
things, and know scientifically what is
a boy, must be able first to ascertain
“what is a man?” But, for
aught I know, my father may have
been satisfied with Buffon on that
score, or he may have sided with
Monboddo. He may have agreed
with Bishop Berkeley—he may have
contented himself with Professor
Combe—he may have regarded the
genus spiritually, like Zeno, or materially,
like Epicurus. Grant that
boy is the male young of man, and he
would have had plenty of definitions
to choose from. He might have said,
“Man is a stomach—<em>ergo</em>, boy a
male young stomach. Man is a brain,—boy
a male young brain. Man is a
bundle of habits—boy a male young
bundle of habits. Man is a machine—boy
a male young machine. Man is
a tail-less monkey—boy a male young
tail-less monkey. Man is a combination
of gases—boy a male young combination
of gases. Man is an appearance—boy
a male young appearance,”
&#38;c. &#38;c., and etcetera, <em>ad infinitum</em>!
And if none of these definitions had
entirely satisfied my father, I am perfectly
persuaded that he would never
have come to Mrs Primmins for a
new one.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it so happened that my father
was at that moment engaged in the
important consideration whether the
Iliad was written by one Homer—or
was rather a collection of sundry ballads,
done into Greek by divers hands,
and finally selected, compiled, and reduced
into a whole by a Committee of
Taste, under that elegant old tyrant
Pisistratus; and the sudden affirmation
“It is a boy,” did not seem
to him pertinent to the thread
of the discussion. Therefore he
asked, “What is a boy?”—vaguely,
and, as it were, taken by surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord, sir!” said Mrs Primmins,
“what is a boy? Why, the baby!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The baby!” repeated my father,
rising. “What, you don’t mean to
say that Mrs Caxton is—eh—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes I do,” said Mrs Primmins,
dropping a curtsey; “and as fine a
little rogue as ever I set eyes upon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor, dear woman!” said my
father with great compassion. “So
soon too—so rapidly!” he resumed in
a tone of musing surprise. “Why,
it is but the other day we were
married!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless my heart, sir,” said Mrs
Primmins, much scandalised, “it
is ten months and more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten months!” said my father with
a sigh. “Ten months! and I have
not finished fifty pages of my refutation
of Wolfe’s monstrous theory! In
ten months a child!—and I’ll be
bound complete—hands, feet, eyes,
ears, and nose!—and not like this
poor Infant of Mind (and my father
pathetically placed his hand on the
treatise)—of which nothing is formed
and shaped—not even the first joint
of the little finger! Why, my wife is
a precious woman! Well, keep her
quiet. Heaven preserve her, and
send me strength—to support this
blessing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But your honour will look at the
baby?—come, sir!” and Mrs Primmins
laid hold of my father’s sleeve
coaxingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at it—to be sure,” said my
father kindly; “look at it, certainly,
it is but fair to poor Mrs Caxton;
after taking so much trouble, dear
soul!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Therewith my father, drawing his
dressing robe round him in more
stately folds, followed Mrs Primmins
up stairs, into a room very carefully
darkened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How are you, my dear?” said my
father, with compassionate tenderness,
as he groped his way to the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A faint voice muttered, “Better
now,—and so happy!” And, at the
same moment, Mrs Primmins pulled
my father away, lifted a coverlid from
a small cradle, and, holding a candle
within an inch of an undeveloped nose,
cried emphatically, “There—bless it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, ma’am, I bless it,” said
my father rather peevishly. “It is my
duty to bless it;—<span class='sc'>Bless it!</span> And this,
then, is the way we come into the
world!—red, very red,—blushing
for all the follies we are destined to
commit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father sat down on the nurse’s
chair, the women grouped round him.
He continued to gaze on the contents
of the cradle, and at length said musingly:—“And
Homer was once like
this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment—and no wonder,
considering the propinquity of the
candle to his visual organs—Homer’s
infant likeness commenced the first
untutored melodies of nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Homer improved greatly in singing
as he grew older,” observed Mr
Squills, the accoucheur, who was engaged
in some mysteries in a corner
of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>My father stopped his ears:—“Little
things can make a great
noise,” said he, philosophically; “and
the smaller the thing the greater noise
it can make.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, he crept on tiptoe to the
bed, and, clasping the pale hand held
out to him, whispered some words
that no doubt charmed and soothed
the ear that heard them, for that pale
hand was suddenly drawn from his
own, and thrown tenderly round his
neck. The sound of a gentle kiss was
heard through the stillness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Caxton, sir,” cried Mr Squills,
in rebuke, “you agitate my patient—you
must retire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father raised his mild face,
looked round apologetically, brushed
his eyes with the back of his hand,
stole to the door, and vanished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think,” said a kind gossip seated
at the other side of my mother’s bed,
“I think, my dear, that Mr Caxton
might have shown more joy,—more
natural feeling, I may say,—at the
sight of the baby: and such a baby!
But all men are just the same, my
dear—brutes—all brutes, depend upon
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Austin!” sighed my mother
feebly—“how little you understand
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now I shall clear the room,”
said Mr Squills.—“Go to sleep, Mrs
Caxton.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Squills,” exclaimed my mother,
and the bed-curtains trembled, “pray
see that Mr Caxton does not set himself
on fire;—and, Mr Squills, tell him
not to be vexed and miss me.—I shall
be down very soon—shan’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you keep yourself easy you will,
ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray say so;—and, Primmins,—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every one, I fear, is neglecting
your master. Be sure,—(and my
mother’s lips approached close to Mrs
Primmins’ ear,)—be sure that you—air
his nightcap yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tender creatures those women,”
soliloquised Mr Squills, as, after clearing
the room of all present, save Mrs
Primmins and the nurse, he took his
way towards my father’s study. Encountering
the footman in the passage,—“John,”
said he, “take supper
into your master’s room—and make
us some punch, will you?—stiffish!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class='c023'>“Mr Caxton, how on earth did
you ever come to marry?” asked Mr
Squills, abruptly, with his feet on the
hob, while stirring up his punch.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was a home question, which
many men might reasonably resent.
But my father scarcely knew what
resentment was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Squills,” said he, turning round
from his books, and laying one finger
on the surgeon’s arm confidentially,—“Squills,”
said he, “I should be
glad to know myself how I came to
be married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Squills was a jovial good-hearted
man—stout, fat, and with fine teeth,
that made his laugh pleasant to look
at as well as to hear. Mr Squills,
moreover, was a bit of a philosopher
in his way;—studied human nature
in curing its diseases;—and was accustomed
to say, that Mr Caxton was a
better book in himself than all he had
in his library. Mr Squills laughed and
rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>My father resumed thoughtfully, and
in the tone of one who moralises:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are three great events in
life, sir; birth, marriage, and death.
None know how they are born, few
know how they die. But I suspect that
many can account for the intermediate
phenomenon—I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was not for money,—it must
have been for love,” observed Mr
Squills; “and your young wife is as
pretty as she is good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha!” said my father, “I remember.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you, sir?” exclaimed Squills,
highly amused. “How was it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father, as was often the case
with him, protracted his reply, and
then seemed rather to commune with
himself than to answer Mr Squills.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The kindest, the best of men,”
he murmured,—“<i><span lang="la">Abyssus Eruditionis</span></i>:
and to think that he bestowed on me
the only fortune he had to leave, instead
of to his own flesh and blood,
Jack and Kitty. All at least that I
could grasp <i><span lang="la">deficiente manu</span></i>, of his
Latin, his Greek, his Orientals. What
do I not owe to him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To whom?” asked Squills. “Good
Lord, what’s the man talking about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” said my father rousing
himself, “such was Giles Tibbets,
M.A., <i><span lang="la">Sol Scientiarum</span></i>, tutor to the
humble scholar you address, and
father to poor Kitty. He left me his
Elzevirs; he left me also his orphan
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! as a wife—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, as a ward. So she came to
live here. I am sure there was no
harm in it. But my neighbours said
there was, and the widow Weltraum
told me the girl’s character
would suffer. What could I do?—Oh
yes, I recollect all now! I
married her, that my old friend’s
child might have a roof to her head,
and come to no harm. You see I
was forced to do her that injury, for
after all, poor young creature, it was
a sad lot for her. A dull book-worm
like me—<i><span lang="la">cochleæ vitam agens</span></i>, Mr
Squills—leading the life of a snail.
But my shell was all I could offer to
my poor friend’s orphan.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Caxton, I honour you,” said
Squills emphatically, jumping up and
spilling half a tumbler-full of scalding
punch over my father’s legs. “You
have a heart, sir! and I understand
why your wife loves you. You seem
a cold man; but you have tears in
your eyes at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dare say I have,” said my
father, rubbing his shins: “it was
boiling!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your son will be a comfort
to you both,” said Mr Squills, reseating
himself, and, in his friendly
emotion, wholly abstracted from all
consciousness of the suffering he had
inflicted. “He will be a dove of peace
to your ark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t doubt it,” said my father
ruefully, “only those doves, when
they are small, are a very noisy sort
of birds—<i><span lang="la">non talium avium cantus
somnum reducunt</span></i>. However, it might
have been worse. Leda had twins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So had Mrs Barnabas last week,”
rejoined the accoucheur. “Who
knows what may be in store for you
yet? Here’s a health to Master Caxton,
and lots of brothers and sisters to
him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brothers and sisters! I am sure
Mrs Caxton will never think of such
a thing, sir,” said my father almost
indignantly. “She’s much too good a
wife to behave so. Once, in a way, it is
all very well; but twice—and as it
is, not a paper in its place, nor a
pen mended the last three days: I,
too, who can only write ‘<i><span lang="la">cuspide
duriusculâ</span></i>’—and the Baker coming
twice to me for his bill too! The
Ilithyiæ are troublesome deities, Mr
Squills.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are the Ilithyiæ,” asked the
accoucheur.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to know,” answered my
father, smiling. “The female dæmons
who presided over the Neogilos or
New-born. They take the name
from Juno. See Homer, book XI.
By the bye, will my Neogilos be
brought up like Hector or Astyanax,—<em>videlicet</em>,
nourished by its mother or
by a nurse?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which do you prefer, Mr
Caxton?” asked Mr Squills, breaking
the sugar in his tumbler. “In this
I always deem it my duty to consult
the wishes of the gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A nurse by all means, then,” said
my father. “And let her carry him
<em>upo kolpo</em>, next to her bosom. I
know all that has been said about
mothers nursing their own infants,
Mr Squills; but poor Kitty is so sensitive,
that I think a stout healthy
peasant woman will be best for the
boy’s future nerves, and his mother’s
nerves, present and future too.
Heigh-ho!—I shall miss the dear
woman very much; when will she
be up, Mr Squills?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, in less than a fortnight!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then the Neogilos shall go
to school! <em>upo kolpo</em>—the nurse with
him, and all will be right again,”
said my father, with a look of sly
mysterious humour, which was peculiar
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“School! when he’s just born?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t begin too soon,” said my
father positively; “that’s Helvetius’
opinion, and it’s mine too!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class='c023'>That I was a very wonderful child,
I take for granted; but, nevertheless,
it was not of my own knowledge that
I came into possession of the circumstances
set down in my former chapters.
But my father’s conduct on the
occasion of my birth made a notable
impression upon all who witnessed it;
and Mr Squills and Mrs Primmins
have related the facts to me sufficiently
often, to make me as well
acquainted with them as those worthy
witnesses themselves. I fancy I see
my father before me, in his dark-gray
dressing-gown, and with his
odd, half sly, half innocent twitch of
the mouth, and peculiar puzzling
look, from two quiet, abstracted, indolently
handsome eyes, at the moment
he agreed with Helvetius on
the propriety of sending me to school
as soon as I was born. Nobody
knew exactly what to make of my
father—his wife excepted. Some set
him down as a sage, some as a fool.
As Hippocrates, in his well-known
letter to Damagetes, saith of the
great Democritus, he was <i><span lang="la">contemptu
et admiratione habitus</span></i>—accustomed
both to contempt and admiration. The
neighbouring clergy respected him as a
scholar, “breathing libraries;” the ladies
despised him as an absent pedant,
who had no more gallantry than a
stock or a stone. The poor loved
him for his charities, but laughed at
him as a weak sort of man, easily
taken in. Yet the squires and farmers
found that, in their own matters
of rural business, he had always a
fund of curious information to impart;
and whoever, young or old, gentle or
simple, learned or ignorant, asked
his advice, it was given with not
more humility than wisdom. In the
common affairs of life, he seemed
incapable of acting for himself; he
left all to my mother; or, if taken
unawares, was pretty sure to be the
dupe. But in those very affairs—if
<em>another</em> consulted him—his eye
brightened, his brow cleared, the desire
of serving made him a new being:
cautious, profound, practical. Too
lazy or too languid where only his
own interests were at stake—touch
his benevolence, and all the wheels
of the clockwork felt the impetus of
the master-spring. No wonder that,
to others, the nut of such a character
was hard to crack! But, in the
eyes of my poor mother, Augustine
(familiarly Austin) Caxton was the
best and the greatest of human
beings; and certainly she ought to
have known him well, for she studied
him with her whole heart, knew every
trick of his face, and, nine times
out of ten, divined what he was
going to say, before he opened his
lips. Yet certainly there were deeps
in his nature which the plummet
of her tender woman’s wit had never
sounded; and, certainly, it sometimes
happened that, even in his
most domestic colloquialisms, my
mother was in doubt whether he was
the simple straightforward person he
was mostly taken for. There was, indeed,
a kind of suppressed subtle irony
about him, too unsubstantial to be
popularly called humour, but dimly
implying some sort of jest, which he
kept all to himself; and this was only
noticeable when he said something
that sounded very grave, or appeared
to the grave very silly and
irrational.</p>

<p class='c009'>That I did not go to school—at
least to what Mr Squills understood
by the word school—quite so soon as
intended, I need scarcely observe.
In fact, my mother managed so well—my
nursery, by means of double
doors, was so placed out of hearing—that
my father, for the most part, was
privileged, if he so pleased, to forget
my existence. He was once dimly
recalled to it on the occasion of my
christening. Now, my father was a
shy man, and he particularly hated
all ceremonies and public spectacles.
He became uneasily aware that a
great ceremony, in which he might
be called upon to play a prominent
part, was at hand. Abstracted as
he was, and conveniently deaf at
times, he had heard significant whispers
about “taking advantage of the
bishop’s being in the neighbourhood,”
and “twelve new jelly glasses being
absolutely wanted,” to be sure that
some deadly festivity was in the wind.
And, when the question of godmother
and godfather was fairly put to him,
coupled with the remark that this was
a fine opportunity to return the
civilities of the neighbourhood, he
felt that a strong effort at escape was
the only thing left. Accordingly,
having, seemingly without listening,
heard the day fixed, and seen,
as they thought, without observing,
the chintz chairs in the best drawing-room
uncovered, (my dear mother
was the tidiest woman in the world,)
my father suddenly discovered that
there was to be a great book sale,
twenty miles off, which would last
four days, and attend it he must.
My mother sighed; but she never
contradicted my father, even when he
was wrong, as he certainly was in
this case. She only dropped a timid
intimation that she feared “It would
look odd, and the world might misconstrue
my father’s absence—had not
she better put off the christening?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear,” answered my father,
“it will be <em>my</em> duty, by-and-by, to
christen the boy—a duty not done in
a day. At present, I have no doubt
that the bishop will do very well
without me. Let the day stand, or,
if you put it off, upon my word and
honour I believe that the wicked auctioneer
will put off the book sale also.
Of one thing I am quite sure, that
the sale and the christening will take
place at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no getting over this;
but I am certain my dear mother had
much less heart than before in uncovering
the chintz chairs, in the
best drawing-room. Five years later
this would not have happened. My
mother would have kissed my father
and said “Stay,” and he would have
staid. But she was then very young
and timid; and he, wild man, not of
the woods but the cloisters, nor yet
civilised into the tractabilities of home.
In short, the post-chaise was ordered
and the carpet-bag packed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My love,” said my mother, the
night before this Hegira, looking up
from her work—“my love, there is
one thing you have quite forgot to
settle—I beg pardon for disturbing
you, but it is important!—baby’s
name; shan’t we call him Augustine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Augustine,” said my father,
dreamily; “why, that name’s mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you would like your boy’s
to be the same?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said my father, rousing
himself. “Nobody would know which
was which. I should catch myself
learning the Latin accidence or playing
at marbles. I should never know
my own identity, and Mrs Primmins
would be giving me pap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My mother smiled; and, putting
her hand, which was a very pretty
one, on my father’s shoulder, and
looking at him tenderly, she said,
“There’s no fear of mistaking you
for any other, even your son, dearest.
Still, if you prefer another name,
what shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Samuel,” said my father. “Dr
Parr’s name is Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“La, my love! Samuel is the ugliest
name—”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father did not hear the exclamation,
he was again deep in his
books; presently he started up:—“Barnes
says Homer is Solomon.
Read Omeros backwards, in the
Hebrew manner—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my love,” interrupted my
mother. “But baby’s christian
name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Omeros—Soremo—Solemo—Solomo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Solomo! shocking,” said my
mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shocking, indeed,” echoed my
father; “an outrage to common
sense.” Then, after glancing again
over his books, he broke out musingly—“But,
after all, it is nonsense
to suppose that Homer was not settled
till <em>his</em> time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whose?” asked my mother, mechanically.</p>

<p class='c009'>My father lifted up his finger.</p>

<p class='c009'>My mother continued, after a short
pause, “Arthur is a pretty name. Then
there’s William—Henry—Charles—Robert.
What shall it be, love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pisistratus?” said my father,
(who had hung fire till then,) in a tone
of contempt—“Pisistratus indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pisistratus! a very fine name,”
said my mother joyfully—“Pisistratus
Caxton. Thank you, my love:
Pisistratus it shall be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you contradict me? Do you
side with Wolf and Heyne, and that
pragmatical fellow Vico? Do you
mean to say that the Rhapsodists?”—</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed,” interrupted my
mother. “My dear, you frighten me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father sighed, and threw himself
back in his chair. My mother took
courage and resumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pisistratus is a long name too!
Still, one could call him Sisty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Siste, Viator,” muttered my father;
“that’s trite!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Sisty by itself—short. Thank
you, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Four days afterwards, on his return
from the book sale, to my father’s
inexpressible bewilderment, he was
informed that “Pisistratus was growing
quite the image of him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When at length the good man was
made thoroughly aware of the fact,
that his son and heir boasted a name so
memorable in history as that borne by
the enslaver of Athens, and the disputed
arranger of Homer—and it was insisted
that it was a name he himself had suggested—he
was as angry as so mild
a man could be. “But it is infamous!”
he exclaimed. “Pisistratus
christened! Pisistratus! who lived six
hundred years before Christ was born.
Good heavens, madam! You have
made me the father of an anachronism.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My mother burst into tears. But the
evil was irremediable. An anachronism
I was, and an anachronism I must
continue to the end of the chapter.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class='c023'>“Of course, sir, you will begin
soon to educate your son yourself?”
said Mr Squills.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, sir,” said my father,
“you have read Martinus Scriblerus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand you, Mr Caxton.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you have <em>not</em> read Martinus
Scriblerus, Mr Squills!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Consider that I have read it, and
what then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why then, Squills,” said my
father familiarly, “you would know,
that though a scholar is often a fool,
he is never a fool so supreme, so
superlative, as when he is defacing
the first unsullied page of the human
history, by entering into it the commonplaces
of his own pedantry. A
scholar, sir, at least one like me, is of
all persons the most unfit to teach
young children. A mother, sir,
a simple, natural, loving mother,
is the infant’s true guide to knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Egad, Mr Caxton, in spite of
Helvetius, whom you quoted the night
the boy was born—egad, I believe
you are right!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure of it,” said my father;
“at least as sure as a poor mortal
can be of any thing. I agree with
Helvetius, the child should be educated
from its birth; but how?—there is the
rub: send him to school forthwith!
Certainly he is at school already with
the two great principles, Nature and
Love. Observe, that childhood and
genius have the same master organ
in common—inquisitiveness. Let
childhood have its way, and as it
began where genius begins, it may
find what genius finds. A certain
Greek writer tells us of some man,
who, in order to save his bees a
troublesome flight to Hymettus, cut
their wings, and placed before them
the finest flowers he could select. The
poor bees made no honey. Now, sir,
if I were to teach my boy, I should
be cutting his wings and giving him
the flowers he should find himself.
Let us leave Nature alone for the
present, and Nature’s living proxy,
the watchful mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Therewith my father pointed to his
heir sprawling on the grass and plucking
daisies on the lawn; while the
young mother’s voice rose merrily,
laughing at the child’s glee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall make but a poor bill out
of your nursery, I see,” said Mr
Squills.</p>

<p class='c009'>Agreeably to these doctrines, strange
in so learned a father, I thrived and
flourished, and learned to spell, and
make pothooks, under the joint care
of my mother and Dame Primmins.
This last was one of an old race fast
dying away—the race of old faithful
servants—the race of old tale-telling
nurses. She had reared my mother
before me; but her affection put out
new flowers for the new generation.
She was a Devonshire woman—and
Devonshire women, especially those
who have passed their youth near the
sea-coast, are generally superstitious.
She had a wonderful budget of fables.
Before I was six years old, I was erudite
in that primitive literature, in
which the legends of all nations are
traced to a common fountain—<cite>Puss
in Boots</cite>, <cite>Tom Thumb</cite>, <cite>Fortunio</cite>, <cite>Fortunatus</cite>,
<cite>Jack the Giant-killer</cite>—tales
like proverbs, equally familiar, under
different versions, to the infant worshipper
of Budh and the hardier
children of Thor. I may say, without
vanity, that in an examination in such
works of imagination, I could have
taken honours!</p>

<p class='c009'>My dear mother had some little
misgivings as to the solid benefit to
be derived from such fantastic erudition,
and timidly consulted my father
therein.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My love,” answered my father,
in that tone of voice which always
puzzled even my mother, to be sure
whether he was in jest or earnest—“in
all these fables, certain philosophers
could easily discover symbolical
significations of the highest morality.
I have myself written a treatise to
prove that <cite>Puss in Boots</cite> is an allegory
upon the progress of the human
understanding, having its origin in
the mystical schools of the Egyptian
priests, and evidently an illustration of
the worship rendered at Thebes and
Memphis to those feline quadrupeds,
of which they made both religious
symbols and elaborate mummies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Austin,” said my mother
opening her blue eyes, “you don’t
think that Sisty will discover all those
fine things in <cite>Puss in Boots</cite>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Kitty,” answered my
father, “you don’t think, when you
were good enough to take up with me,
that you found in me all the fine
things I have learned from books.
You knew me only as a harmless
creature, who was happy enough to
please your fancy. By-and-by you
discovered that I was no worse for all
the quartos that have transmigrated
into ideas within me—ideas that are
mysteries even to myself. If Sisty,
as you call the child, (plague on that
unlucky anachronism! which you do
well to abbreviate into a dissyllable,)
if Sisty can’t discover all the wisdom
of Egypt in <cite>Puss in Boots</cite>, what then?
<cite>Puss in Boots</cite> is harmless, and it
pleases his fancy. All that wakes
curiosity is wisdom, if innocent—all
that pleases the fancy now, turns hereafter
to love or to knowledge. And
so, my dear, go back to the nursery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But I should wrong thee, O best
of fathers, if I suffered the reader to
suppose, that because thou didst seem
so indifferent to my birth, and so careless
as to my early teaching, therefore
thou wert, at heart, indifferent
to thy troublesome Neogilos. As I
grew older, I became more sensibly
aware that a father’s eye was upon
me. I distinctly remember one incident,
that seems to me, in looking
back, a crisis in my infant life, as
the first tangible link between my
own heart and that calm great
soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>My father was seated on the lawn
before the house, his straw hat over
his eyes (it was summer) and his book
on his lap. Suddenly a beautiful delf
blue-and-white flower-pot, which had
been set on the window-sill of an
upper storey, fell to the ground with a
crash, and the fragments spluttered
up round my father’s legs. Sublime in
his studies as Archimedes in the siege,
he continued to read “<i><span lang="la">Impavidum
feriunt ruinæ!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear, dear!” cried my mother,
who was at work in the porch, “my
poor flower-pot that I prized so much!
Who could have done this? Primmins,
Primmins!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Primmins popped her head out
of the fatal window, nodded to the
summons, and came down in a trice,
pale and breathless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said my mother, mournfully,
“I would rather have lost all
the plants in the greenhouse in the
great blight last May,—I would
rather the best tea-set were broken!
The poor geranium I reared myself,
and the dear, dear flower-pot which
Mr Caxton bought for me my last
birth-day! That naughty child must
have done this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Primmins was dreadfully afraid
of my father—why, I know not, except
that very talkative social persons are
usually afraid of very silent shy ones.
She cast a hasty glance at her master,
who was beginning to evince signs of
attention, and cried promptly, “No,
ma’am, it was not the dear boy, bless
his flesh, it was I!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You! how could you be so careless?
and you knew how I prized them
both. Oh, Primmins!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Primmins began to sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t tell fibs, nursey,” said a
small shrill voice; and Master Sisty
(coming out of the house as bold as
brass) continued rapidly—“don’t scold
Primmins, mamma: it was I who
pushed out the flower-pot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” said nurse, more frightened
than ever, and looking aghast
towards my father, who had very
deliberately taken off his hat, and
was regarding the scene with serious
eyes wide awake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! And if he did break it,
ma’am, it was quite an accident; he
was standing so, and he never meant
it. Did you, Master Sisty? Speak!
(this in a whisper) or Pa will be so
angry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said my mother, “I suppose
it was an accident; take care in
future, my child. You are sorry, I see,
to have grieved me. There’s a kiss,
don’t fret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, mamma, you must not kiss
me, I don’t deserve it. I pushed out
the flower-pot on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha! and why?” said my father,
walking up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Primmins trembled like a leaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For fun!” said I, hanging my
head—“just to see how you’d look,
papa; and that’s the truth of it. Now
beat me, do beat me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father threw his book fifty yards
off, stooped down, and caught me to
his breast. “Boy,” he said, “you have
done wrong: you shall repair it by
remembering all your life that your
father blessed God for giving him a
son who spoke truth in spite of fear!
Oh! Mrs Primmins, the next fable of
this kind you try to teach him, and we
part for ever!”</p>

<p class='c009'>From that time I first date the hour
when I felt that I loved my father,
and knew that he loved me; from that
time too, he began to <em>converse</em> with
me. He would no longer, if he met
me in the garden, pass by with a
smile and nod; he would stop, put his
book in his pocket, and though his
talk was often above my comprehension,
still somehow I felt happier and
better, and less of an infant, when I
thought over it, and tried to puzzle
out the meaning; for he had a way of
suggesting, not teaching, putting
things into my head, and then leaving
them to work out their own problems.
I remember a special instance with
respect to that same flower-pot and
geranium. Mr Squills, who was a
bachelor, and well to do in the world,
often made me little presents. Not
long after the event I have narrated,
he gave me one far exceeding in
value those usually bestowed on children,—it
was a beautiful large domino-box
in cut ivory, painted and gilt.
This domino-box was my delight. I
was never weary of playing at dominoes
with Mrs Primmins, and I slept
with the box under my pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” said my father one day when
he found me ranging the ivory squares
in the parlour, “ah! you like that
better than all your playthings, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You would be very sorry if your
mamma was to throw that box out of
the window, and break it for fun.” I
looked beseechingly at my father, and
made no answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But perhaps you would be very
glad,” he resumed, “if suddenly one
of these good fairies you read of could
change the domino-box into a beautiful
geranium in a beautiful blue-and-white
flower-pot, and that you could
have the pleasure of putting it on your
mamma’s window-sill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I would!” said I, half crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear boy, I believe you; but
good wishes don’t mend bad actions,—good
actions mend bad actions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, he shut the door and
went out. I cannot tell you how
puzzled I was to make out what my
father meant by his aphorism. But
I know that I played at dominoes no
more that day. The next morning
my father found me seated by myself
under a tree in the garden; he paused
and looked at me with his grave bright
eyes very steadily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My boy,” said he, “I am going to
walk to —— (a town about two miles
off,) will you come? and, by the
bye, fetch your domino-box: I should
like to show it to a person there.” I
ran in for the box, and, not a little
proud of walking with my father upon
the high-road, we set out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa,” said I by the way, “there
are no fairies now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What then, my child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—how then can my domino-box
be changed into a geranium and a
blue-and-white flower-pot?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear,” said my father, leaning
his hand on my shoulder, “every
body who is in earnest to be good, carries
two fairies about with him—one
here,” and he touched my heart; “and
one here,” and he touched my forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand, papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can wait till you do, Pisistratus!
What a name!”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father stopped at a nursery gardener’s,
and, after looking over the
flowers, paused before a large double
geranium. “Ah, this is finer than
that which your mamma was so fond
of. What is the cost, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only 7s. 6d.,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>My father buttoned up his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t afford it to-day,” said he
gently, and we walked out.</p>

<p class='c009'>On entering the town, we stopped
again at a china-warehouse. “Have
you a flower-pot like that I bought
some months ago? Ah, here is one,
marked 3s. 6d. Yes, that is the
price. Well, when your mamma’s
birth-day comes again, we must buy
her another. That is some months to
wait. And we can wait, Master Sisty.
For truth, that blooms all the year
round, is better than a poor geranium;
and a word that is never broken, is
better than a piece of delf.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My head, which had drooped before,
rose again; but the rush of joy
at my heart almost stifled me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have called to pay your little
bill,” said my father, entering the shop
of one of those fancy stationers common
in country towns, and who sell
all kinds of pretty toys and nicknacks.
“And by the way,” he added,
as the smiling shopman looked over
his books for the entry, “I think my
little boy here can show you a much
handsomer specimen of French workmanship
than that work-box which
you enticed Mrs Caxton into raffling
for, last winter. Show your domino-box,
my dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I produced my treasure, and the
shopman was liberal in his commendations.
“It is always well, my
boy, to know what a thing is worth, in
case one wishes to part with it. If my
young gentleman gets tired of his
plaything, what will you give him for
it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, sir,” said the shopman, “I
fear we could not afford to give more
than eighteen shillings for it, unless
the young gentleman took some of
these pretty things in exchange.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eighteen shillings!” said my father;
“you would give <em>that</em>. Well,
my boy, whenever you do grow tired
of your box, you have my leave to
sell it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father paid his bill, and went
out. I lingered behind a few moments,
and joined him at the end of
the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa, papa!” I cried, clapping
my hands, “we can buy the geranium—we
can buy the flower-pot.”
And I pulled a handful of silver from
my pockets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I not say right?” said my
father, passing his handkerchief over
his eyes—“You have found the two
fairies!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh! how proud, how overjoyed I
was, when, after placing vase and
flower on the window-sill, I plucked
my mother by the gown, and made her
follow me to the spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is his doing, and his money!”
said my father; “good actions have
mended the bad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” cried my mother, when
she had learned all; “and your
poor domino-box that you were
so fond of! We will go back to-morrow,
and buy it back, if it costs us
double.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we buy it back, Pisistratus?”
asked my father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh no—no—no! It would spoil
all,” I cried, burying my face on my
father’s breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My wife,” said my father solemnly,
“this is my first lesson to
our child—the sanctity and the happiness
of self-sacrifice—undo not what
it should teach to his dying day!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And that is the history of the broken
flower-pot.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class='c023'>When I was between my seventh
and my eighth year, a change came
over me, which may perhaps be familiar
to the notice of those parents
who boast the anxious blessing of an
only child. The ordinary vivacity of
childhood forsook me; I became
quiet, sedate, and thoughtful. The
absence of playfellows of my own
age, the companionship of mature
minds alternated only by complete
solitude, gave something precocious,
whether to my imagination or my
reason. The wild fables muttered to
me by the old nurse in the summer
twilight, or over the winter’s hearth—the
effort made by my struggling
intellect to comprehend the grave,
sweet wisdom of my father’s suggested
lessons—tended to feed a
passion for reverie, in which all my
faculties strained and struggled, as in
the dreams that come when sleep is
nearest waking. I had learned to
read with ease, and to write with
some fluency, and I already began to
imitate, to reproduce. Strange tales,
akin to those I had gleaned from
fairyland—rude songs, modelled from
such verse-books as fell into my hands,
began to mar the contents of marble-covered
pages, designed for the less
ambitious purposes of round text and
multiplication. My mind was yet
more disturbed by the intensity of
my home affections. My love for
both my parents had in it something
morbid and painful. I often wept to
think how little I could do for those I
loved so well. My fondest fancies
built up imaginary difficulties for
them, which my arm was to smoothe.
These feelings, thus cherished, made
my nerves over-susceptible and acute.
Nature began to affect me powerfully;
and from that affection rose a restless
curiosity to analyse the charms that
so mysteriously moved me to joy or
awe, to smiles or tears. I got my
father to explain to me the elements
of astronomy; I extracted from
Squills, who was an ardent botanist,
some of the mysteries in the life of
flowers. But music became my darling
passion. My mother (though
the daughter of a great scholar—a
scholar at whose name my father
raised his hat, if it happened to be on
his head) possessed, I must own it
fairly, less book-learning than many
a humble tradesman’s daughter can
boast in this more enlightened generation;
but she had some natural
gifts which had ripened, Heaven
knows how! into womanly accomplishments.
She drew with some
elegance, and painted flowers to exquisite
perfection. She played on
more than one instrument with more
than boarding-school skill; and though
she sang in no language but her own,
few could hear her sweet voice without
being deeply touched. Her music,
her songs, had a wondrous effect on
me. Thus, altogether, a kind of
dreamy yet delightful melancholy
seized upon my whole being; and
this was the more remarkable, because
contrary to my earlier temperament,
which was bold, active, and
hilarious. The change in my character
began to act upon my form. From
a robust and vigorous infant, I grew
into a pale and slender boy. I began
to ail and mope. Mr Squills was
called in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tonics!” said Mr Squills; “and
don’t let him sit over his book. Send
him out in the air—make him play.
Come here, my boy—these organs
are growing too large;” and Mr
Squills, who was a phrenologist,
placed his hand on my forehead.
“Gad, sir, here’s an ideality for you;
and, bless my soul, what a constructiveness!”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father pushed aside his papers,
and walked to and fro the room with
his hands behind him; but he did
not say a word till Mr Squills was
gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear,” then said he to my
mother, on whose breast I was leaning
my aching ideality—“my dear, Pisistratus
must go to school in good
earnest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless me, Austin!—at his age?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is nearly eight years old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he is so forward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is for that reason he must go
to school.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t quite understand you, my
love. I know he is getting past me;
but you who are so clever—”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father took my mother’s hand—“We
can teach him nothing now,
Kitty. We send him to school to be
taught—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By some schoolmaster who knows
much less than you do—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By little schoolboys, who will
make him a boy again,” said my
father, almost sadly. “My dear,
you remember that, when our Kentish
gardener planted those filbert-trees,
and when they were in their
third year, and you began to calculate
on what they would bring in,
you went out one morning, and found
he had cut them down to the ground.
You were vexed, and asked why.
What did the gardener say? ‘To
prevent their bearing too soon.’ There
is no want of fruitfulness here—put
back the hour of produce, that the
plant may last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go to school,” said I,
lifting my languid head, and smiling
on my father. I understood him at
once, and it was as if the voice of my
life itself answered to him.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class='c023'>A year after the resolution thus
come to, I was at home for the holidays.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope,” said my mother, “that
they are doing Sisty justice. I do
think he is not nearly so quick a
child as he was before he went to
school. I wish you would examine
him, Austin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have examined him, my dear.
It is just as I expected; and I am quite
satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! you really think he has
come on?” said my mother joyfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He does not care a button for
botany now,” said Mr Squills.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And he used to be so fond of music,
dear boy!” observed my mother
with a sigh. “Good gracious! what
noise is that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your son’s pop-gun against the
window,” said my father. “It is
lucky it is only the window; it would
have made a less deafening noise,
though, if it had been Mr Squills’
head, as it was yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The left ear,” observed Squills;
“and a very sharp blow it was, too.
Yet you are satisfied, Mr Caxton?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I think the boy is now as
great a blockhead as most boys of his
age are,” observed my father with
great complacency.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me, Austin—a great blockhead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What else did he go to school
for?” asked my father; and observing
a certain dismay in the face of his
female audience, and a certain surprise
in that of his male, he rose and stood
on the hearth, with one hand in his
waistcoat, as was his wont when
about to philosophise in more detail
than was usual to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr Squills,” said he, “you have
had great experience in families.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As good a practice as any in the
county,” said Mr Squills proudly:
“more than I can manage. I shall
advertise for a partner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And,” resumed my father, “you
must have observed almost invariably
that, in every family, there is what
father, mother, uncle and aunt, pronounce
to be one wonderful child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One at least,” said Mr Squills,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is easy,” continued my father,
“to say this is parental partiality,—but
it is not so. Examine that child
as a stranger, and it will startle yourself.
You stand amazed at its eager
curiosity, its quick comprehension,
its ready wit, its delicate perception.
Often, too, you will find some faculty
strikingly developed; the child will
have a turn for mechanics, perhaps,
and make you a model of a steamboat,—or
it will have an ear tuned to
verse, and will write you a poem like
that it has got by heart from ‘The
Speaker,’—or it will take to botany,
(like Pisistratus) with the old maid
its aunt,—or it will play a march on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>its sister’s pianoforte. In short, even
you, Squills, will declare that it is
really a wonderful child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon my word,” said Mr Squills
thoughtfully, “there’s a great deal of
truth in what you say; little Tom
Dobbs <em>is</em> a wonderful child—so is
Frank Steppington—and as for
Johnny Styles, I must bring him here
for you to hear him prattle on Natural
History, and see how well he handles
his pretty little microscope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven forbid!” said my father.
“And now let me proceed. These
<em>thaumata</em> or wonders last till when,
Mr Squills?—last till the boy goes to
school, and then, somehow or other,
the <em>thaumata</em> vanish into thin air, like
ghosts at the cockcrow. A year after
the prodigy has been at the academy,
father and mother, uncle and aunt,
plague you no more with his doings
and sayings; the extraordinary infant
has become a very ordinary little boy.
Is it not so, Mr Squills?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed you are right, sir. How
did you come to be so observant; you
never seem to—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” interrupted my father;
and then, looking fondly at my mother’s
anxious face, he said, soothingly—“be
comforted: this is wisely
ordained—and it is for the best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It must be the fault of the
school,” said my mother, shaking her
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the necessity of the school,
and its virtue, my Kate. Let any
one of these wonderful children—wonderful
as you thought Sisty himself—stay
at home, and you will
see its head grow bigger and bigger,
and its body thinner and thinner—Eh,
Mr Squills?—till the mind take
all nourishment from the frame,
and the frame, in turn, stint or
make sickly the mind. You see
that noble oak from the window—if
the Chinese had brought it up, it
would have been a tree in miniature
at five years old, and at an hundred,
you would have set it in a flower-pot
on your table, no bigger than it was
at five—a curiosity for its matureness
at one age—a show for its diminutiveness
at the other. No! the
ordeal for talent is school; restore
the stunted mannikin to the growing
child, and then let the child if it can,
healthily, hardily, naturally, work its
slow way up into greatness. If greatness
be denied it, it will at least be a
man, and that is better than to be
a little Johnny Styles all its life—an
oak in a pill-box.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment I rushed into the
room, glowing and panting, health
on my cheek, vigour in my limbs—all
childhood at my heart. “Oh!
mamma, I have got up the kite—so
high!—come and see. Do come,
papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” said my father; “only,
don’t cry so loud—kites make no
noise in rising—yet, you see how
they soar above the world. Come,
Kate, where is my hat? Ah—thank
you, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kitty,” said my father, looking
at the kite which, attached by its
string to the peg I had stuck into
the ground, rested calm in the sky,
“never fear but what our kite shall
fly as high; only, the human soul
has stronger instincts to mount upward
than a few sheets of paper on
a framework of lath. But, observe,
that to prevent its being lost in the
freedom of space, we must attach it
lightly to earth; and, observe again,
my dear, that the higher it soars, the
more string we must give it.”</p>

of January 1848, it amounted to 5,179,644,730 francs. Far from taking advantage
of so long a peace to reduce the amount of the debt, the last administration augmented
it in those enormous proportions,—912,329,328 francs in seven years.</p>

    <div>“BUDGETS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The budgets followed the progression of the debt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those of 1829 to 1830 amount to 1,014,914,000 francs. The entire of the credits
placed at the disposal of the fallen government to the year 1847 amounts to
1,712,979,639f. 62c. Notwithstanding the successive increase of the receipts, the
budgets presented each year a considerable deficit. The expenses from 1840 to
1847 inclusively, exceeded the receipts by 604,525,000 francs. The deficit calculated
for the year 1848 is 48,000,000 francs, without counting the additional chapter of
supplementary and extraordinary credits, which will raise the total amount of the
budgets to the charge of the last administration to 652,525,000 francs.</p>

    <div>“PUBLIC WORKS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The public works heedlessly undertaken simultaneously, at all points of the territory,
to satisfy or to encourage electoral corruption, and not with that reserve which
prudence so imperiously commanded, have raised the credits to 1,081,000,000 francs.
From this sum are to be deducted the sums reimbursed by the companies, amounting
to 160,000,000 francs; the last loan, 82,000,000 francs, making together 242,000,000
francs, and leaving a balance of 839,000,000 francs. Out of this sum, 435,000,000
francs has been expended out of the resources of the floating debt, and 404,000,000
francs still remain to be expended on the completion of the works.</p>

    <div>“FLOATING DEBT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The floating debt increased in proportions not less considerable. At the commencement
of 1831 it reached an amount of about 250,000,000 francs. At the date
of the 26th of February last it exceeded 670,000,000 francs, to which is to be added
the government stock belonging to the savings’ banks, 202,000,000 francs, making
altogether 972,000,000 francs. Under such a system the position of the central
office of the Treasury could not often be brilliant. During the two hundred and
sixty-eight last days of its existence, the fallen government expended more than
294,800,000 francs beyond its ordinary resources, or 1,100,000 francs per day.”—<cite>Report
of Finance Minister</cite>, March 9, 1848.</p>
